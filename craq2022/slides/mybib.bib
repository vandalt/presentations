	abstract = {Optical velocimetry has led to the detection of more than 500 planets to date and there is a strong effort to push m/s velocimetry to the near-infrared to access cooler and lighter stars. The presence of numerous telluric absorption lines in the nIR brings an important challenge. As the star's barycentric velocity varies through the year, the telluric absorption lines effectively varies in velocity relative to the star's spectrum by the same amount leading to important systematic RV offsets. We present a novel Principal component analysis-based approach for telluric line subtraction and demonstrated its effectiveness with archival HARPS data for GJ436 and τ Ceti, over parts of the R-band that contain strong telluric absorption lines. The main results are: 1) a better RV accuracy with excluding only a few percentage of the domain, 2) better use of the entire spectrum to measure RV and 3) a higher telescope time efficency by using A0V telluric standard from telescope archive.},

	abstract = {The present-day envelope of gaseous planets is a relic of how these giant planets originated and evolved. Measuring their elemental composition therefore presents a powerful opportunity to answer long-standing questions regarding planet formation. Obtaining precise observational constraints on the elemental inventory of giant exoplanets has, however, remained challenging owing to the limited simultaneous wavelength coverage of current space-based instruments. Here, we present thermal emission observations of the nontransiting hot Jupiter τ Boo b using the new wide wavelength coverage (0.95-2.50 μm) and high spectral resolution (R = 70,000) CFHT/SPIRou spectrograph. By combining a total of 20 hr of SPIRou data obtained over five nights in a full atmospheric retrieval framework designed for high-resolution data, we constrain the abundances of all the major oxygen- and carbon-bearing molecules and recover a noninverted temperature structure using a new free-shape, nonparametric temperature-pressure profile retrieval approach. We find a volume mixing ratio of log(CO) = - and a highly depleted water abundance of less than 0.0072 times the expected value for a solar composition envelope. Combined with upper limits on the abundances of CH4, CO2, HCN, TiO, and C2H2, this results in a gas-phase C/H ratio of × solar, consistent with the value of Jupiter, and an envelope C/O ratio robustly greater than 0.60, even when taking into account the oxygen that may be sequestered out of the gas phase. Combined, the inferred supersolar C/H, O/H, and C/O ratios on τ Boo b support a formation scenario beyond the water snowline in a disk enriched in CO owing to pebble drift.},

We also describe the various ways to calculate Fourier quantities, and discuss different calibration strategies. We present the results of image reconstructions from simulated observations where we adjust prior images, weighting schemes, and error bar estimation. We compare two imaging algorithms and discuss implications for reconstructing images from real observations.

	abstract = {One aim of modern astronomy is to detect temperate, Earth-like exoplanets that are well suited for atmospheric characterization. Recently, three Earth-sized planets were detected that transit (that is, pass in front of) a star with a mass just eight per cent that of the Sun, located 12 parsecs away. The transiting configuration of these planets, combined with the Jupiter-like size of their host star—named TRAPPIST-1—makes possible in-depth studies of their atmospheric properties with present-day and future astronomical facilities. Here we report the results of a photometric monitoring campaign of that star from the ground and space. Our observations reveal that at least seven planets with sizes and masses similar to those of Earth revolve around TRAPPIST-1. The six inner planets form a near-resonant chain, such that their orbital periods (1.51, 2.42, 4.04, 6.06, 9.1 and 12.35 days) are near-ratios of small integers. This architecture suggests that the planets formed farther from the star and migrated inwards. Moreover, the seven planets have equilibrium temperatures low enough to make possible the presence of liquid water on their surfaces.},

We find that \$41{\textasciicircum}\{+15\}\_\{-13\}{\textbackslash}\%\$ of systems with a close-in, small planet also host an outer giant, compared to \$17.6{\textasciicircum}\{+2.4\}\_\{-1.9\}{\textbackslash}\%\$ for stars irrespective of small planet presence. This implies that small planet hosts may be enhanced in outer giant occurrence compared to all stars with \$1.7{\textbackslash}sigma\$ significance. Conversely, we estimate that \$42{\textasciicircum}\{+17\}\_\{-13\}{\textbackslash}\%\$ of cold giant hosts also host an inner small planet, compared to \$27.6{\textasciicircum}\{+5.8\}\_\{-4.8\}{\textbackslash}\%\$ of stars irrespective of cold giant presence. We also find that more massive and close-in giant planets are not associated with small inner planets. Specifically, our sample indicates that small planets are less likely to host outer giant companions more massive than approximately 120 Earth masses and within 0.3--3 au than to host less massive or more distant giant companions, with \${\textbackslash}sim\$2.2\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ confidence. This implies that massive gas giants within 0.3--3 au may suppress inner small planet formation. Additionally, we compare the host-star metallicity distributions for systems with only small planets and those with both small planets and cold giants. In agreement with previous studies, we find that stars in our survey that only host small planets have a metallicity distribution that is consistent with the broader solar-metallicity-median sample, while stars that host both small planets and gas giants are distinctly metal-rich with \${\textbackslash}sim\$2.3\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ confidence.},

	abstract = {Context. Kernel phase is a data analysis method based on a generalization of the notion of closure phase, which was invented in the context of interferometry, but it applies to well corrected diffraction dominated images produced by an arbitrary aperture. The linear model upon which it relies theoretically leads to the formation of observable quantities robust against residual aberrations. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: In practice, the detection limits that have been reported thus far seem to be dominated by systematic errors induced by calibration biases that were not sufficiently filtered out by the kernel projection operator. This paper focuses on the impact the initial modeling of the aperture has on these errors and introduces a strategy to mitigate them, using a more accurate aperture transmission model. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: The paper first uses idealized monochromatic simulations of a nontrivial aperture to illustrate the impact modeling choices have on calibration errors. It then applies the outlined prescription to two distinct data sets of images whose analysis has previously been published. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The use of a transmission model to describe the aperture results is a significant improvement over the previous type of analysis. The thus reprocessed data sets generally lead to more accurate results, which are less affected by systematic errors. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: As kernel-phase observing programs are becoming more ambitious, accuracy in the aperture description is becoming paramount to avoid situations where contrast detection limits are dominated by systematic errors. The prescriptions outlined in this paper will benefit from any attempt at exploiting kernel phase for high-contrast detection.},

In the high Strehl ratio regime, the relation between the phase measured in the Fourier plane and the wavefront errors in the pupil can be linearized, as was shown in a previous work that introduced the notion of generalized closure-phase, or kernel-phase. The technique, to be usable as presented requires two conditions to be met: (1) the wavefront errors must be kept small (of the order of one radian or less), and (2) the pupil must include some asymmetry, which can be introduced with a mask, for the problem to become solvable. Simulations show that this asymmetric pupil Fourier wavefront sensing or APF-WFS technique can improve the Strehl ratio from 50\% to over 90\% in just a few iterations, with excellent photon noise sensitivity properties, suggesting that on-sky close loop APF-WFS is possible with an extreme adaptive optics system.},

	abstract = {The accumulation of aberrations along the optical path in a telescope produces distortions and speckles in the resulting images, limiting the performance of cameras at high angular resolution. It is important to achieve the highest possible sensitivity to faint sources, using both hardware and data analysis software. While analytic methods are efficient, real systems are better modeled numerically, but numerical models of complicated optical systems with many parameters can be hard to understand, optimize, and apply. Automatic differentiation or “backpropagation” software developed for machine-learning applications now makes calculating derivatives with respect to aberrations in arbitrary planes straightforward for any optical system. We apply this powerful new tool to the problem of high-angular-resolution astronomical imaging. Self-calibrating observables such as the “closure phase” or “bispectrum” have been widely used in optical and radio astronomy to mitigate optical aberrations and achieve high-fidelity imagery. Kernel phases are a generalization of closure phases valid in the limit of small phase errors. Using automatic differentiation, we reproduce existing kernel phase theory within this framework and demonstrate an extension to the case of a Lyot coronagraph, which is found to have self-calibrating combinations of speckles. which are resistant to phase noise, but only in the very high-wave-front-quality regime. As an illustrative example, we reanalyze Palomar adaptive optics observations of the binary α Ophiuchi, finding consistency between the new pipeline and the existing standard. We present a new Python package morphine that incorporates these ideas, with an interface similar to the popular package poppy, for optical simulation with automatic differentiation. These methods may be useful for designing improved astronomical optical systems by gradient descent.},

This survey used nonredundant aperture mask interferometry to achieve typical contrast limits of Δ K {\textasciitilde} 5-6 at the diffraction limit, revealing 12 new binary companions that lay below the detection limits of traditional high-resolution imaging; we also summarize a complementary snapshot imaging survey that discovered seven directly resolved companions. The overall frequency of binary companions ({\textasciitilde}35-4+5\% at separations of 6-435 AU) appears to be equivalent to field stars of similar mass, but companions could be more common among lower mass stars than for the field. The companion mass function has statistically significant differences compared to several suggested mass functions for the field, and we suggest an alternate lognormal parameterization of the mass function. Our survey limits encompass the entire brown dwarf mass range, but we only detected a single companion that might be a brown dwarf; this deficit resembles the so-called brown dwarf desert that has been observed by radial velocity planet searches. Finally, our survey's deep detection limits extend into the top of the planetary mass function, reaching 8-12 MJup for half of our sample. We have not identified any planetary companions at high confidence (gtrsim99.5\%), but we have identified four candidate companions at lower confidence (gtrsim97.5\%) that merit additional follow-up to confirm or disprove their existence.},

	abstract = {Les observations à haute résolution du ciel sont assurées par deux grandes techniques : l'imagerie et l'interférométrie. L'imagerie consiste à estimer la distribution spatiale d'intensité d'une source, en formant une image de cette distribution d'intensité sur une plaque photosensible, anciennement chimiquement (plaque photographique), mais désormais exclusivement électronique, sous la forme de détecteur. L'imagerie est limitée par la qualité des images produites, qui peut être approximée par la taille de l'image que forme un point source sur le détecteur. Plus cette image est petite, plus la résolution est importante. La deuxième technique, l'interférométrie consiste à exploiter les propriétés ondulatoires de la lumière pour former non pas une image, mais des franges d'interférence, qui encodent dans leur position et leur contraste des informations sur la structure spatiale de l'objet observé.Bien que l'interférométrie et l'imagerie soient deux techniques différentes, et que leurs spécialistes tendent à former des communautés distinctes, les phénomènes à l'œuvre lors de la formation d'une image d'une part, et d’une figure d'interférence d'autre part sont fondamentalement les mêmes. Cela permet, sous certaines conditions, d'exploiter des techniques interférométriques sur des images. Une de ces techniques permet de former clôtures de phases, des observables robustes aux défauts optiques à partir d'observations interférométriques. Si les défauts optiques sont assez faibles (avec des erreurs sur le chemin optique plus petites que la longueur d'onde), il est possible de former des observables analogues à ces clôtures de phase à partir d'images, appelées des kernel phases, ou noyaux de phase.Le régime dans lequel ces observables peuvent être extraites n'a été rendu accessible que récemment, avec le lancement des premiers télescopes spatiaux d'une part, et d'autre part l'émergence de l'optique adaptative, qui peut corriger en temps réel les défauts liés aux turbulences atmosphériques. Si les défauts sont assez faibles, les images sont dites "limitées par la diffraction“ : la réponse du télescope peut être considérée comme dominée par les effets de diffraction, qui dépendent de la géométrie de l'ouverture d'entrée, et les défauts optiques comme des perturbations de la diffraction.Dans ce régime, la structure de la perturbation peut être utilisée pour construire des observables qu'elle n'affecte pas. Ces observables ne sont toutefois pas robustes à toutes les erreurs. Dans ce cas, je me suis concentré sur la détection de binaires dans les kernel phases extraites à partir d'images, en utilisant des méthodes statistiques robustes. En théorie de la détection, la procédure la plus efficace pour détecter un signal dans des données bruitées est le rapport de vraisemblance. Ici, je propose trois tests, tous basés sur cette procédure optimale pour effectuer des détections systématiques de binaires dans des images. Ces procédures sont applicables aux kernels phases extraites à partir de n'importe quelle image.Les performances de ces procédures de détection sont ensuite prédites pour des observations de naines brunes de type Y avec le télescope spatial James Webb. Nous montrons que des détections de binaires sont possible à des contrastes pouvant atteindre 1000 à des séparations correspondant à la limite de diffraction, qui est communément admise comme la "limite de résolution“ d'un télescope formant des images. Ces performances font de l'interférométrie kernel une méthode performante pour la détection de binaires de faible intensité. Ces limites dépendent fortement du flux disponible, qui détermine l'erreur sur les valeurs de flux mesurées au niveau de chaque pixel, et, par extension les erreurs qui affectent les kernel phases.},

	abstract = {Context
              . The
              James Webb
              Space Telescope (JWST) will offer high angular resolution observing capability in the near-infrared with masking interferometry on the Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS), and coronagraphic imaging on the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). Full-aperture kernel-phase-based interferometry complements these observing modes by allowing us to probe for companions at small angular resolution while preserving the telescope throughput.
            
            
              Aims
              . Our goal is to derive both theoretical and operational contrast-detection limits for the kernel-phase analysis of JWST NIRISS full-pupil observations using tools from hypothesis testing theory. The study is immediately applied to observations of faint brown dwarfs with this instrument, but the tools and methods introduced here are applicable in a wide variety of contexts.
            
            
              Methods
              . We construct a statistically independent set of observable quantities from a collection of aberration-robust kernel phases. Three detection tests based on these observable quantities are designed and analysed, all having the property of guaranteeing a constant false-alarm rate for phase aberrations smaller than about one radian. One of these tests, the likelihood ratio or Neyman-Pearson test, provides a theoretical performance bound for any detection test.
            
            
              Results
              . The operational detection method considered here is shown to exhibit only marginal power loss with respect to the theoretical bound. In principle, for the test set to a false-alarm probability of 1\%, companions at contrasts reaching 10
              3
              and separations of 200 mas around objects of magnitude 14.1 are detectable with a probability of 68\%. For the brightest objects observable using the full pupil of JWST and NIRISS, contrasts of up to 10
              4
              at separations of 200 mas could ultimately be achieved, barring significant wavefront drift. We also provide a statistical analysis of the uncertainties affecting the contrasts and separations that are estimated for the detected companions.
            
            
              Conclusions
              . The proposed detection method is close to the ultimate bound and offers guarantees on the probability of making a false detection for binaries, as well as on the error bars for the estimated parameters of the binaries that will be detected by JWST NIRISS. This method is not only applicable to JWST NIRISS but to any imaging system with adequate sampling.},

	abstract = {Many images are constructed by active convolution arising from scanning motion. In others, even though motion is absent, the dependence of the image on the object can be expressed as a convolution integral, at least approximately. Examples of the former arise when the ground is scanned by the antenna of a microwave radiometer carried in an airplane or satellite for remote sensing purposes, when the sky is scanned by a radio telescope as in radio astronomy, or when a photographic transparency is scanned by passing light through a small orifice to a photodetector as in microdensitometry. When an object is photographed, pp the image is produced simultaneously rather than sequentially, but the intervention of the camera lens introduces degradation which also involves two-dimensional convolution. Image construction for the most part is linear, but even with linearity the convolution relation may be perturbed where there is partial failure of space invariance, as with lenses. Not uncommonly (as with overexposure or underexposure) there may also be some degree of nonlinearity. Both linearity and space invariance are prerequisites to the following discussion, which treats cases where there is a simple convolution relation between object and image. First we consider methods such as antenna scanning and photography, where the convolving function is a compact but fuzzy diffraction pattern, and then microdensitometry and other types of imaging, where the convolving function is more or less sharply bounded.},

	abstract = {Whenever a time-varying quantity has to be measured, there is an inevitable blurring due to the nonzero time interval necessary to make a single measurement. Consequently, the measurement relating to a given instant always lumps together values that occurred during the measurement interval. the time-varying quantity is varying slowly, or if the time resolution is short, the measurement may be very good; but some degree of smoothing is in principle always present. That means that a measured waveform never faithfully represents the original quantity. Therefore, one may ask what correction has to be applied to the measurement. In the development given below it is supposed that convolution is involved, but it is understood that convolution is merely an important case of the more general linear functional. Measurements may also involve a little nonlinearity and a little hysteresis. Even so, as will be seen, there is enough complication in the simple presentation below to suffice for a first study. A further limitation may be mentioned. In some subjects, including astronomy, meteorology, and geophysics, the measurements, or observations, may be all we know about the time-varying quantity; in fact the purpose of the observations may be to find out what is there. In such a case the “time-varying quantity” is just a concept without any reality of its own; only the measurements exist and are available to work with. In experimental subjects, as distinct from the observational, the underlying quantity may be verifiable by alternative methods, but in the final analysis measurement is always conducted to a finite resolution. Procedures for combating the smoothing effect of instrumental intervention are known as restoration.},

But other projections, such as the projection ∫ f(x, y) dy′ onto the x′-axis, where (x′, y′) is a rotated coordinate system, contain different information. From a set of such projections one might hope to be able to reconstruct the original function. The best-known example comes from x-ray computed tomography, where Hounsfield’s brain scanner has had a dramatic effect in radiology and dependent fields such as neurology, but reconstruction of projections was already known in more than one branch of astronomy and has continued to arise in many different contexts. Some indispensable preliminary theory for following the reconstruction techniques is given in the preceding chapter. In this chapter the theory is developed in terms of the x-ray application in order to get the benefit of being able to interpret the equations in physical terms.},

In other words, if two different input impulses are considered, one shifted in time by any amount with respect to the other, then the responses will be the same, allowing for the time shift. In two dimensions, where the variables represent space, the corresponding attribute of a system is space invariance. Suppose that a television camera is pointed at a blackboard. Then a space-invariant system has the property of imaging the blackboard onto the screen of the television display so that two different white dots of chalk, no matter where they are in the plane of the board, produce appropriately shifted identical images (Fig. 6-1).},

But in two dimensions there are two generalizations, the second being concentration on a line. One class of examples is furnished by the familiar mechanical notion of pressure; in mechanics, the oldest branch of physics, the concept that we require is well established in connection with the theoretical idea of a point force or point load applied to a surface. We recall that in one dimension the term impulse itself derives from mechanics, where it signifies the time integral of a force that is applied for a time that is more or less short. It is therefore useful, in introducing the theory of impulse functions on the plane, to appeal to the subject of mechanics, where the essential concepts are already familiar. First we deal with the two-dimensional point impulse or dot and then with a variety of impulse arrays and with impulsive entities that are not restricted to a point but are distributed along straight or curved lines. The δ-notation of P. A. M. Dirac (1902–1987) generalizes to allow convenient representation of the two-dimensional concepts.},

Circular symmetry also occurs in objects that are under study (some astronomical objects, for example) or in objects that influence imaging (rain drops), and is a property of many artifacts. Because of the prevalence of circular symmetry, particularly in instruments, special attention to circularly symmetrical transforms is warranted.

	abstract = {Noise in an image can be defined as the unwanted part of that image. The noise may be random in some way, as is the pepper-and-salt appearance on a television screen when the station goes off the air, or it may be systematic, as with the ghost seen when an echo of the wanted signal arrives with a time delay after reflection from a hill. When the television image responds independently to sparks in a faulty thermostat in the nearby refrigerator or to a faulty ignition system on a passing motorcycle, the noise exhibits both random and systematic features. In other cases, the wanted signal may be random; thermal microwave or infrared radiation used for mapping the ground is of this nature. As a result, one person’s noise may be another person’s signal and vice versa. Very often it does not matter much what the character of the noise is, only its magnitude is needed, an attitude that is reflected in the term signal-to-noise ratio. As the examples show, the noise in an image need not be independent of, but can be closely connected with, the wanted signal itself. In the latter case if the signal is removed, the noise will change. When the noise is independent, it may be studied on its own in the absence of any wanted signal.},

Not only are there polar coordinates and other coordinate systems in addition to cartesian, but sampling can be done along lines as well as at points. The distinction between point and line sampling will be discussed first. Since sampling at regular intervals plays a major role, we pass on to regular point sampling as expressed in one dimension by the shah function III(x), an entity that was introduced earlier in connection with delta functions. In two dimensions we find the direct generalization 2III(x, y), which occupies a square lattice of points, together with a range of other manifestations of the shah function. Since the Fourier transform of a sampling pattern is a transfer function, this treatment brings us to the brink of digital filtering. Before developing this subject in the next chapter, however, we discuss the sampling theorem and interpolation.},

It is, of course, perfectly all right to describe photography as in the introductory sentence above, but with the caveat that the description involves information about certain entities (the source elements and the propagation medium) that are unascertainable by the camera alone. In many branches of science the output of the observing instruments is the only information—astronomy is one example, and seismic exploration of the earth’s interior is another. Both of these endeavors produce images of inaccessible regions of physical space, and they suggest another, more operational, way of describing image formation.},

It corresponds with the plane of the grid used by Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) as illustrated in Fig. 2-1 and with the film plane in a camera. However, not all images arise from projection: image plane is a more general term for the domain of a plane image. Images may be presented in many ways, such as by photography, television, or printing, and there are other modes of presentation that may be equivalent to images. Examples of equivalents include an array of numbers, a voltage waveform (from which a television picture could be generated), or a contour diagram of the kind introduced in 1728 by M. S. Cruquius and most familiar (Fig. 2-2) in the representation of surface relief on maps. One chooses according to end use: a passport photo rendered in grey levels is more appropriate than the equivalent contour diagram or matrix of numerical values, if it is a matter of identifying the bearer. All of these forms, in one way or another, are equivalent to a single-valued scalar function of two variables. and therefore the theory of such functions must be basic to an understanding of images. even though a full understanding of images may go farther.},

The creation of images was once mainly in the hands of artists and scribes. Their art works—the famous stone-age cave paintings, the engravings on stone, bone and tooth, and the paintings on bark and skin that have been lost—go back to the distant past. Their inscriptions are also images, though of a different kind. They are also very old. as witnessed by hieroglyphic writing on the walls of tombs and on papyrus in Egypt. In modem times artists and scribes were joined by photographers and printers as creators of images. A variety of artisans, playing a secondary role as artists, created a third kind of image: ornament manifested on pottery, in woven fabrics and carpets, in tile patterns, and in painted friezes. Builders and cartographers created a fourth kind of image, once relatively rare but nevertheless going back to antiquity: construction plans and maps.},

	abstract = {The photometric method detects planets orbiting other stars by searching for the reduction in the light flux or the change in the color of the stellar flux that occurs when a planet transits a star. A transit by Jupiter or Saturn would reduce the stellar flux by approximately 1\% while a transit by Uranus or Neptune would reduce the stellar flux by 0.1\%. A highly characteristic color change with an amplitude approximately 0.1 of that for the flux reduction would also accompany the transit and could be used to verify that the source of the flux reduction was a planetary transit rather than some other phenomenon. Although the precision required to detect major planets is already available with state-of-the-art photometers, the detection of terrestrial-sized planets would require a precision substantially greater than the state-of-the-art and a spaceborne platform to avoid the effects of variations in sky transparency and scintillation. Because the probability is so small of observing a planetary transit during a single observation of a randomly chosen star, the search program must be designed to continuously monitor hundreds or thousands of stars. The most promising approach is to search for large planets with a photometric system that has a single-measurement precision of 0.1\%. If it is assumed that large planets will have long-period orbits, and that each star has an average of one large planet, then approximately 104 stars must be monitored continuously. To monitor such a large groups of stars simultaneously while maintaining the required photometric precision, a detector array coupled by a fiber-optic bundle to the focal plane of a moderate aperture (≈ 1 m), wide field of view (≈50°) telescope is required. Based on the stated assumptions, a detection rate of one planet per year of observation appears possible.},

	abstract = {Precise and accurate parameters for late-type (late K and M) dwarf stars are important for characterization of any orbiting planets, but such determinations have been hampered by these stars’ complex spectra and dissimilarity to the Sun. We exploit an empirically calibrated method to estimate spectroscopic effective temperature (Teff) and the Stefan-Boltzmann law to determine radii of 183 nearby K7-M7 single stars with a precision of 2\%-5\%. Our improved stellar parameters enable us to develop model-independent relations between Teff or absolute magnitude and radius, as well as between color and Teff. The derived Teff-radius relation depends strongly on [Fe/H], as predicted by theory. The relation between absolute KS magnitude and radius can predict radii accurate to ≃ 3\%. We derive bolometric corrections to the V\{\{R\}C\}\{\{I\}C\}grizJH\{\{K\}S\} and Gaia passbands as a function of color, accurate to 1\%-3\%. We confront the reliability of predictions from Dartmouth stellar evolution models using a Markov chain Monte Carlo to find the values of unobservable model parameters (mass, age) that best reproduce the observed effective temperature and bolometric flux while satisfying constraints on distance and metallicity as Bayesian priors. With the inferred masses we derive a semi-empirical mass-absolute magnitude relation with a scatter of 2\% in mass. The best-agreement models overpredict stellar Teff values by an average of 2.2\% and underpredict stellar radii by 4.6\%, similar to differences with values from low-mass eclipsing binaries. These differences are not correlated with metallicity, mass, or indicators of activity, suggesting issues with the underlying model assumptions, e.g., opacities or convective mixing length.},

We identified 156 planet candidates, including one object that was not previously identified as a Kepler Object of Interest. We inspected all publicly available follow-up images, observing notes, and centroid analyses, and corrected for the likelihood of false positives. We evaluated the sensitivity of our detection pipeline on a star-by-star basis by injecting 2000 transit signals into the light curve of each target star. For periods shorter than 50 days, we find \{0.56\}-0.05+0.06 Earth-size planets (1-1.5 R⊕) and \{0.46\}-0.05+0.07 super-Earths (1.5-2 R⊕) per M dwarf. In total, we estimate a cumulative planet occurrence rate of 2.5 ± 0.2 planets per M dwarf with radii 1-4 R⊕ and periods shorter than 200 days. Within a conservatively defined habitable zone (HZ) based on the moist greenhouse inner limit and maximum greenhouse outer limit, we estimate an occurrence rate of \{0.16\}-0.07+0.17 Earth-size planets and \{0.12\}-0.05+0.10 super-Earths per M dwarf HZ. Adopting the broader insolation boundaries of the recent Venus and early Mars limits yields a higher estimate of \{0.24\}-0.08+0.18 Earth-size planets and \{0.21\}-0.06+0.11 super-Earths per M dwarf HZ. This suggests that the nearest potentially habitable non-transiting and transiting Earth-size planets are 2.6 ± 0.4 pc and \{10.6\}-1.8+1.6 pc away, respectively.

We analyse the capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope in the determination of the spectra of occulted starspots, despite its lack of optical wavelength instruments on board. Focusing on K and M spectral types, we simulate starspots with different temperatures and in different locations of the stellar disc, and find that starspot temperatures can be determined to within a few hundred kelvins using NIRSpec/Prism and the proposed NIRCam/F150W2\$+\$F322W2's broad wavelength capabilities.

	abstract = {We present a basic, fast, and flexible planet formation model, called SimAb (Simulating Abundances), to form giant planets and study their primary atmospheric composition soon after their formation. In SimAb we introduce parameters to simplify the assumptions about the complex physics involved in the formation of a planet. This approach allows us to trace and understand the influence of complex physical processes on the formed planets. We focus on the C/O ratio and the metallicity of the planetary atmosphere as an indicator of their compositions. We show that the initial protoplanet core mass does not influence the final composition of the planetary atmosphere in the context of our model. The initial orbital distance affects the C/O ratio due to the different C/O ratios in the gas phase and the solid phase at different orbital distances. Additionally, the initial orbital distance together with the amount of accreted planetesimals cause the planet to have sub-solar or super-solar metallicity. Furthermore, the C/O ratio is affected by the dust grain fraction and the planetesimal fraction. Planets that accrete most of their heavy elements through dust grains will have a C/O ratio close to the solar C/O ratio, while planets that accrete most of their heavy elements from the planetesimals in the disk will end up with a C/O ratio closer to the C/O ratio in the solid phase of the disk. By using the C/O ratio and metallicity together we can put a lower and upper boundary on the initial orbital distance where super-solar metallicity planets are formed. We show that planetesimals are the main source for reaching super-solar metallicity planets. On the other hand, planets that mainly accrete dust grains will show a more solar composition. Super-solar metallicity planets that initiate their formation farther than the CO ice line have a C/O ratio closer to the solar value.},

	url = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv211100059E},
	abstract = {Planets between 1-4 Earth radii with orbital periods {\textless}100 days are strikingly common. The migration model proposes that super-Earths migrate inwards and pile up at the disk inner edge in chains of mean motion resonances. After gas disk dispersal, simulations show that super-Earth's gravitational interactions can naturally break their resonant configuration leading to a late phase of giant impacts. The instability phase is key to matching the orbital spacing of observed systems. Yet, most previous simulations have modelled collisions as perfect accretion events, ignoring fragmentation. In this work, we investigate the impact of imperfect accretion on the breaking the chains scenario. We performed N-body simulations starting from distributions of planetary embryos and modelling the effects of pebble accretion and migration in the gas disk. Our simulations also follow the long-term dynamical evolution of super-Earths after the gas disk dissipation. We compared the results of simulations where collisions are treated as perfect merging events with those where imperfect accretion and fragmentation are allowed. We concluded that the perfect accretion is a suitable approximation in this regime, from a dynamical point of view. Although fragmentation events are common, only {\textasciitilde}10\% of the system mass is fragmented during a typical "late instability phase", with fragments being mostly reacreted by surviving planets. This limited total mass in fragments proved to be insufficient to alter qualitatively the final system dynamical configuration -- e.g. promote strong dynamical friction or residual migration -- compared to simulations where fragmentation is neglected.},

With the 3D nature of exoplanet atmospheres being important in giving rise to their observable properties, accurate and fast 3D methods are required to be developed to meet future multi-dimensional and temporal data sets. We develop an open source GPU RT code, gCMCRT, a Monte Carlo RT forward model for general use in planetary atmosphere RT problems. We aim to automate the post-processing pipeline, starting from direct global circulation model (GCM) output to synthetic spectra. We develop albedo, emission and transmission spectra modes for 3D and 1D input structures. We include capability to use correlated-k and high-resolution opacity tables, the latter of which can be Doppler shifted inside the model. We post-process results from several GCM groups including ExoRad, SPARC/MITgcm THOR, UK Met Office UM, Exo-FMS and the Rauscher model. Users can therefore take advantage of desktop and HPC GPU computing solutions. gCMCRT is well suited for post-processing large GCM model grids produced by members of the community and for high-resolution 3D investigations.},

	abstract = {Interior modeling of Jupiter and Saturn has advanced to a state where thousands of models are generated that cover the uncertainty space of many parameters. This approach demands a fast method of computing their gravity field and shape. Moreover, the Cassini mission at Saturn and the ongoing Juno mission delivered gravitational harmonics up to J12. Here, we report the expansion of the Theory of Figures, which is a fast method for gravity field and shape computation, to the 7th-order (ToF7), which allows for computation of up to J14. We apply three different codes to compare the accuracy using polytropic models. We apply ToF7 to Jupiter and Saturn interior models in conjunction with CMS-19 H/He-EOS. For Jupiter, we find that J6 is best matched by a transition from He-depleted to He-enriched envelope at 2-2.5 Mbar. However, the atmospheric metallicity reaches 1xtimes solar only if the adiabat is perturbed toward lower densities, or if the surface temperature is enhanced by {\textasciitilde}14 K from the Galileo value. Our Saturn models imply a largely homogeneous-in-Z envelope at 1.5-4x solar atop a small core. Perturbing the adiabat yields metallicity profiles with extended, heavy-element enriched deep interior (diffuse core) out to 0.4 RSat, as for Jupiter. Classical models with compact, dilute, or no core are possible as long as the deep interior is enriched in heavy-elements. Including a thermal wind fitted to the observed wind speeds, representative Jupiter and Saturn models are consistent with all observed Jn values.},

It is through these giant impacts that planets like the young Earth grow to their final mass and achieve long-term stable orbital configurations. A key prediction is that these impacts produce debris. To date, the most compelling observational evidence for post-impact debris comes from the planetary system around the nearby 23 Myr-old A star HD 172555. This system shows large amounts of fine dust with an unusually steep size distribution and atypical dust composition, previously attributed to either a hypervelocity impact or a massive asteroid belt. Here, we report the spectrally resolved detection of a CO gas ring co-orbiting with dusty debris between {\textasciitilde}6-9 au - a region analogous to the outer terrestrial planet region of our Solar System. Taken together, the dust and CO detections favor a giant impact between large, volatile-rich bodies. This suggests that planetary-scale collisions, analogous to the Moon-forming impact, can release large amounts of gas as well as debris, and that this gas is observable, providing a window into the composition of young planets.},

With the unparalleled sensitivity of JWST and the MIRI detectors, the MRS has the potential to revolutionise our understanding of giant exoplanet atmospheres. Molecular mapping is a promising detection and characterisation technique used to study the spectra of directly imaged exoplanets. We aim to examine the feasibility and application of this technique to MRS observations. We used the instrument simulator MIRISIM to create mock observations of resolved star and exoplanet systems. As an input for the simulator, we used stellar and planet parameters from literature, with the planet spectrum being modelled with the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS. After processing the raw data with the JWST pipeline, we high pass filter the data to account for the stellar point spread function, and used a forward modelling approach to detect the companions and constrain the chemical composition of their atmospheres through their molecular signatures. We identified limiting factors in spectroscopic characterisation of directly imaged exoplanets with the MRS and simulated observations of two representative systems, HR8799 and GJ504. In both systems, we could detect the presence of multiple molecules that were present in the input model of their atmospheres. We used two different approaches with single molecule forward models, used in literature, that are sensitive to detecting mainly H\$\_2\$O, CO, CH\$\_4\$, and NH\$\_3\$, and a log-likelihood ratio test that uses full atmosphere forward models and is sensitive to a larger number of less dominant molecular species. We show that the MIRI MRS can be used to characterise widely separated giant exoplanets in the mid-IR using molecular mapping.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric mass-loss is known to play a leading role in sculpting the demographics of small, close-in exoplanets. Understanding the impact of such mass-loss driven evolution requires modelling large populations of planets to compare with the observed exoplanet distributions. As the quality of planet observations increases, so should the accuracy of the models used to understand them. However, to date, only simple semi-analytic models have been used in such comparisons since modelling populations of planets with high accuracy demands a high computational cost. To address this, we turn to machine learning. We implement random forests trained on atmospheric evolution models, including XUV photoevaporation, to predict a given planet's final radius and atmospheric mass. This evolution emulator is found to have an RMS fractional radius error of 1\${\textbackslash}\%\$ from the original models and is \${\textbackslash}sim 400\$ times faster to evaluate. As a test case, we use the emulator to infer the initial properties of Kepler-36b and c, confirming that their architecture is consistent with atmospheric mass loss. Our new approach opens the door to highly sophisticated models of atmospheric evolution being used in demographic analysis, which will yield further insight into planet formation and evolution.},

	abstract = {Measurements of the atmospheric carbon (C) and oxygen (O) relative to hydrogen (H) in hot Jupiters (relative to their host stars) provide insight into their formation location and subsequent orbital migration. Hot Jupiters that form beyond the major volatile (H2O/CO/CO2) ice lines and subsequently migrate post disk-dissipation are predicted have atmospheric carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O) near 1 and subsolar metallicities, whereas planets that migrate through the disk before dissipation are predicted to be heavily polluted by infalling O-rich icy planetesimals, resulting in C/O {\textless} 0.5 and super-solar metallicities. Previous observations of hot Jupiters have been able to provide bounded constraints on either H2O or CO, but not both for the same planet, leaving uncertain the true elemental C and O inventory and subsequent C/O and metallicity determinations. Here we report spectroscopic observations of a typical transiting hot Jupiter, WASP-77Ab. From these, we determine the atmospheric gas volume mixing ratio constraints on both H2O and CO (9.5\${\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$ - 1.5\${\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$ and 1.2\${\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$ - 2.6\${\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$, respectively). From these bounded constraints, we are able to derive the atmospheric C/H (0.35\${\textasciicircum}\{+0.17\}\_\{-0.10\}\$ \${\textbackslash}times\$ Solar) and O/H (0.32 \${\textasciicircum}\{+0.12\}\_\{-0.08\}\$ \${\textbackslash}times\$ Solar) abundances and the corresponding atmospheric carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O=0.59\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.08; the solar value is 0.55). The sub-solar (C+O)/H (0.33\${\textasciicircum}\{+0.13\}\_\{-0.09\}\$ \${\textbackslash}times\$ Solar) is suggestive of a metal-depleted atmosphere relative to what is expected for Jovian-like planets while the near solar value of C/O rules out the disk-free migration/C-rich atmosphere scenario.},

Our new XMM-Newton X-ray observations of the system show that the fast-rotating F-type host star exhibits a high X-ray luminosity of 2.3e29{\textasciitilde}erg/s (5-100 A), corresponding to a flux of 6.9e4 erg/cm**2/s at the planetary orbit, which results in an energy-limited escape estimate of about 1e13 g/s for the planetary mass-loss rate. The spectral time series show significant, time-dependent absorption in the Halpha and He I triplet lines with maximum depths of about 3.3\% and 5.3\%. The mid-transit absorption signals in the Halpha and He I lines are consistent with results from one-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling, which also yields mass-loss rates on the order of 1e13 g/s. We observe an early ingress of a redshifted component of the transmission signal, which extends into a redshifted absorption component, persisting until about the middle of the optical transit. While a super-rotating wind can explain redshifted ingress absorption, we find that an up-orbit stream, transporting planetary mass in the direction of the star, also provides a plausible explanation for the pre-transit signal.

We aim to investigate the origin of the discrepant results reported in the literature about the presence of Na I in the atmosphere of HD209458 b, based on low- and high-resolution transmission spectroscopy. Methods. We generated synthetic planetary atmosphere models and we compared them with the transmission light curves and spectra observed in previous studies. Our models account for the stellar limb-darkening and Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effects, and contemplate various possible scenarios for the planetary atmosphere. Results. We reconciled the discrepant results by identifying a range of planetary atmospheres that are consistent with previous low- and high-resolution spectroscopic observations. Either both datasets are interpreted as consistent with a total absence of Na I in the planetary atmosphere (with Hubble Space Telescope data being affected by limb darkening), or the terminator temperature of HD209458 b has to have an upper limit of about 1000K. In particular, we find that 1D transmission spectra with lower-than-equilibrium temperatures can also explain the previously reported detection of absorption signal at low resolution due to differential transit depth in adjacent bands, while the cores of the Na I D lines may be masked by the strong RM signal seen at high resolution. We also rule out high-altitude clouds, which would otherwise mask the absorption signal at low resolution, as the source of the discrepancies. Conclusions. This work highlights the synergies between different observing techniques, specifically low- and high-resolution spectroscopy, to fully characterise transiting exoplanet systems.},

We have implemented the disequilibrium effect of vertical mixing or quenching for the major species in hydrogen/helium-dominated atmospheres, namely \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{CH\_4\}\$, \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{CO\}\$, \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{H\_2O\}\$, \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{NH\_3\}\$, \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{N\_2\}\$, and \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{CO\_2\}\$, for the spectral retrieval code ARCiS with a physical basis using the chemical relaxation method. Then, using ARCiS updated with this module, we have performed retrievals of the observed transmission spectra of 16 exoplanets with sizes ranging from Jupiter to mini-Neptune. As a result, we find indications of disequilibrium chemistry for HD 209458b (\${\textbackslash}geq 4.1{\textbackslash}sigma\$) and WASP-39b (\${\textbackslash}geq 2.7{\textbackslash}sigma\$). The retrieved spectrum of HD 209458b exhibits a strong \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{NH\_3\}\$ absorption feature at 10.5 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m accessible by JWST owing to an enhanced abundance of \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{NH\_3\}\$ due to the quenching effect. This feature is absent in the spectrum retrieved assuming equilibrium chemistry, which makes HD 209458b an ideal target for studying disequilibrium chemistry in exoplanet atmospheres. Moreover, for HAT-P-11b and GJ 436b, we obtain relatively different results than for the retrieval with the equilibrium assumption, such as a \$2.9{\textbackslash}sigma\$ difference for the C/O ratio. We have also examined the retrieved eddy diffusion coefficient, but could not identify a trend over the equilibrium temperature, possibly due to the limits of the current observational precision.},

	abstract = {51 Eri b is one of the only young planets consistent with a wide range of possible initial entropy states, including the cold-start scenario associated with some models of planet formation by core accretion. The most direct way to constrain the initial entropy of a planet is by measuring its luminosity and mass at a sufficiently young age that the initial conditions still matter. We present the tightest upper limit on 51 Eri b's mass yet (M {\textless} 11 Mjup at 2\${\textbackslash}sigma\$) using a cross-calibration of Hipparcos and Gaia EDR3 astrometry and the orbit-fitting code orvara. We also reassess its luminosity using a direct, photometric approach, finding log(Lbol/Lsun) = -5.5\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.2 dex. Combining this luminosity with the 24\${\textbackslash}pm\$3 Myr age of the \${\textbackslash}beta\$ Pic moving group, of which 51 Eri is a member, we derive mass distributions from a grid of evolutionary models that spans a wide range of initial entropies. We find that 51 Eri b is inconsistent with the coldest-start scenarios, requiring an initial entropy of {\textgreater}8 \$k\_B\$/baryon at 97\% confidence. This result represents the first observational constraint on the initial entropy of a potentially cold-start planet, and it continues the trend of dynamical masses for directly imaged planets pointing to warm- or hot-start formation scenarios.},

	abstract = {We report helium absorption from the escaping atmosphere of TOI 560.01 (HD 73583b), a \$R=2.8 R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$, \$P=6.4\$ d mini Neptune orbiting a young (\${\textbackslash}sim\$600 Myr) K dwarf. Using Keck/NIRSPEC, we detect a signal with an average depth of \$0.68 {\textbackslash}pm 0.08\$\% in the line core. The absorption signal repeats during a partial transit obtained a month later, but is marginally stronger and bluer, perhaps reflecting changes in the stellar wind environment. Ingress occurs on time, and egress occurs within 12 minutes of the white light egress, although absorption rises more gradually than it declines. This suggests that the outflow is slightly asymmetric and confined to regions close to the planet. The absorption signal also exhibits a slight 4 km/s redshift rather than the expected blueshift; this might be explained if the planet has a modest orbital eccentricity, although the radial velocity data disfavors such an explanation. We use XMM-Newton observations to reconstruct the high energy stellar spectrum and model the planet's outflow with 1D and 3D hydrodynamic simulations. We find that our models generally overpredict the measured magnitude of the absorption during transit, the size of the blueshift, or both. Increasing the metallicity to 100\${\textbackslash}times\$ solar suppresses the signal, but the dependence of the predicted signal strength on metallicity is non-monotonic. Decreasing the assumed stellar EUV flux by a factor of 3 likewise suppresses the signal substantially.},

	abstract = {The bulk chemical composition and interior structure of rocky exoplanets are of fundamental importance to understanding their long-term evolution and potential habitability. Observations of the chemical compositions of the solar system rocky bodies and of other planetary systems have increasingly shown a concordant picture that the chemical composition of rocky planets reflects that of their host stars for refractory elements, whereas this expression breaks down for volatiles. This behavior is explained by devolatilization during planetary formation and early evolution. Here, we apply a devolatilization model calibrated with the solar system bodies to the chemical composition of our nearest Sun-like stars -- \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ Centauri A and B -- to estimate the bulk composition of any habitable-zone rocky planet in this binary system ("\${\textbackslash}alpha\$-Cen-Earth"). Through further modeling of likely planetary interiors and early atmospheres, we find that compared to Earth, such a planet is expected to have (i) a reduced (primitive) mantle that is similarly dominated by silicates albeit enriched in carbon-bearing species (graphite/diamond); (ii) a slightly larger iron core, with a core mass fraction of \$38.4\_\{-5.1\}{\textasciicircum}\{+4.7\}\$ wt\% (cf. Earth's 32.5 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.3 wt\%); (iii) an equivalent water-storage capacity; and (iv) a CO\$\_2\$-CH\$\_4\$-H\$\_2\$O-dominated early atmosphere that resembles that of Archean Earth. Further taking into account its \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 25\% lower intrinsic radiogenic heating from long-lived radionuclides, an ancient \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-Cen-Earth (\${\textbackslash}sim\$ 1.5-2.5 Gyr older than Earth) is expected to have less efficient mantle convection and planetary resurfacing, with a potentially prolonged history of stagnant-lid regimes.},

	abstract = {Tidal interactions play an important role in many astrophysical systems, but uncertainties regarding the tides of rapidly rotating, centrifugally distorted stars and gaseous planets remain. We have developed a precise method for computing the dynamical, non-dissipative tidal response of rotating planets and stars, based on summation over contributions from normal modes driven by the tidal potential. We calculate the normal modes of isentropic polytropes rotating at up to {\textasciitilde}90\% of their critical breakup rotation rates, and tabulate fits to mode frequencies and tidal overlap coefficients that can be used to compute the frequency-dependent tidal response (via potential Love numbers). Although fundamental modes (f-modes) dominate the tides at all rotation rates, we find that the strong coupling of retrograde inertial modes (i-modes) to tesseral (l{\textgreater}{\textbar}m{\textbar}) components of the tidal potential produces resonances that may be relevant to gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn. The coupling of f-modes in rapid rotators to multiple components of both the driving tidal potential and the induced gravitational field also affect the tesseral response, leading to significant deviations from treatments of rotation that neglect centrifugal distortion and high-order corrections. For very rapid rotation rates ({\textgreater}70\% of breakup), mixing between prograde f-modes and i-modes significantly enhances the sectoral (l={\textbar}m{\textbar}) tidal overlap of the latter. The tidal response of very rapidly rotating, centrifugally distorted planets or stars can also be modified by resonant sectoral f-modes that are secularly unstable via the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz (CFS) mechanism.},

The two TESS-detected planets are of radius 0.70\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.04 \$R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ and 0.98\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.06 \$R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ in 0.86-day and 3.69-day orbits, respectively.

HARPS RV monitoring yields 97.7 percentile mass upper limits of 0.35 \$M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ and 1.4 \$M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ for planets b and c, respectively. The astrometric companion detected by the CTIO/SMARTS 0.9m has an orbital period on the order of decades and is undetected by other means. Additional ground-based observations constrain the companion to being a high-mass brown dwarf or smaller. Each planet is of unique interest; the inner planet has an ultra-short period, and the outer planet is in the Venus zone. Both are promising targets for atmospheric characterization with the JWST and mass measurements via extreme-precision radial velocity. A third planet candidate of radius 0.9\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.1 \$R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ in a 4.97-day orbit is also identified in multi-Cycle TESS data for validation in future work. The host star is associated with an observed gap in the lower main sequence of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. This gap is tied to the transition from partially- to fully-convective interiors in M dwarfs, and the effect of the associated stellar astrophysics on exoplanet evolution is currently unknown. The culmination of these system properties makes LHS 1678 a unique, compelling playground for comparative exoplanet science and understanding the formation and evolution of small, short-period exoplanets orbiting low-mass stars.},

To address this deficit, we present the GRanulation And Spectrum Simulator (\${\textbackslash}texttt\{GRASS\}\$), a new tool designed to create time-series synthetic spectra with granulation-driven variability from spatially- and temporally-resolved observations of solar absorption lines. In this work, we present \${\textbackslash}texttt\{GRASS\}\$, detail its methodology, and validate its model against disk-integrated solar observations. As a first-of-its-kind empirical model for spectral variability due to granulation in a star with perfectly known center-of-mass radial-velocity behavior, \${\textbackslash}texttt\{GRASS\}\$ is an important tool for testing new methods of disentangling granular line-shape changes from true Doppler shifts.},

	url = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv211011946L},
	abstract = {Ultra-hot Jupiters have dayside temperatures at which most molecules are expected to thermally dissociate. The dissociation of water vapour results in the production of the hydroxyl radical (OH). While OH absorption is easily observed in near-infrared spectra of M dwarfs, which have similar effective temperatures as ultra-hot Jupiters, it is often not considered when studying the atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters. We use high-resolution spectroscopic observations of a transit of WASP-76b obtained using CARMENES to study the presence of OH. After validating the OH line list, we generate model transit spectra of WASP-76b with petitRADTRANS. The data are corrected for stellar and telluric contamination and cross-correlated with the model spectra. After combining all cross-correlation functions from the transit, a detection map is constructed. Constraints on the planet properties from the OH absorption are obtained from a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis. OH is detected in the atmosphere of WASP-76b with a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 6.1. From the retrieval we obtain \$K\_p=232 {\textbackslash}pm 12\$ km/s and a blueshift of \$-13.2 {\textbackslash}pm 1.6\$ km/s, which are offset from the expected velocities. Considering the fast spin rotation of the planet, the blueshift is best explained with the signal predominantly originating from the evening terminator and the presence of a strong dayside-to-nightside wind. The increased \$K\_p\$ over its expected value (196.5 km/s) is, however, a bit puzzling. The signal is found to be broad, with a full width at half maximum of \$16.8{\textasciicircum}\{+4.6\}\_\{-4.0\}\$ km/s. The retrieval results in a weak constraint on the mean temperature of 2700-3700 K at the pressure range of the OH signal. We show that OH is readily observable in the transit spectra of ultra-hot Jupiters. Studying this molecule can provide insights into the molecular dissociation processes in the atmospheres of such planets.},

We investigate best practices for applying this framework to temperature maps of hot Jupiters by splitting the problem into two parts: (1) we constrain the temperature map as a function of latitude by tuning the basis functions to reproduce general circulation model (GCM) outputs, since disk-integrated phase curve observations do not constrain this dimension; and (2) we infer the temperature maps of real hot Jupiters using original reductions of several Spitzer phase curves, which directly constrain the temperature variations with longitude. The resulting phase curves can be described with only three free parameters per bandpass -- an efficiency improvement over the usual five or so used to describe sinusoidal decompositions of phase curves. Upon obtaining the hemispherically averaged dayside and nightside temperatures, the standard approach would be to use zero-dimensional box models to infer the Bond albedo and redistribution efficiency. We elucidate the limitation of these box models by demonstrating that negative Bond albedos may be obtained due to a choice of boundary condition on the nightside temperature. We propose generalized definitions for the Bond albedo and heat redistribution efficiency for use with two-dimensional (2D) temperature maps. Open-source software called kelp is provided to efficiently compute these phase curves.},

	abstract = {Exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres commonly show signs of disequilibrium chemistry. In the James Webb Space Telescope era high resolution spectra of directly imaged exoplanets will allow the characterization of their atmospheres in more detail, and allow systematic tests for the presence of chemical species that deviate from thermochemical equilibrium in these atmospheres. Constraining the presence of disequilibrium chemistry in these atmospheres as a function of parameters such as their effective temperature and surface gravity will allow us to place better constrains in the physics governing these atmospheres. This paper is part of a series of works presenting the Sonora grid of atmosphere models (Marley et al 2021, Morley et al in prep.). In this paper we present a grid of cloud-free, solar metallicity atmospheres for brown dwarfs and wide separation giant planets with key molecular species such as CH4, H2O, CO and NH3 in disequilibrium. Our grid covers atmospheres with Teff{\textasciitilde}[500 K,1300 K], logg{\textasciitilde}[3.0,5.5] (cgs) and an eddy diffusion parameter of logKzz=2, 4 and 7 (cgs). We study the effect of different parameters within the grid on the temperature and composition profiles of our atmospheres. We discuss their effect on the near-infrared colors of our model atmospheres and the detectability of CH4, H2O, CO and NH3 using the JWST. We compare our models against existing MKO and Spitzer observations of brown dwarfs and verify the importance of disequilibrium chemistry for T dwarf atmospheres. Finally, we discuss how our models can help constrain the vertical structure and chemical composition of these atmospheres.},

	abstract = {We present EOS, a procedure for determining the Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) albedo for a wide range of conditions expected to be present in the atmospheres of rocky planets with temperate conditions. EOS is based on HELIOS and HELIOS-K, which are novel and publicly available atmospheric radiative transfer (RT) codes optimized for fast calculations with GPU processors. These codes were originally developed for the study of giant planets. In this paper we present an adaptation for applications to terrestrial-type, habitable planets, adding specific physical recipes for the gas opacity and vertical structure of the atmosphere. To test the reliability of the procedure we assessed the impact of changing line opacity profile, continuum opacity model, atmospheric lapse rate and tropopause position prescriptions on the OLR and the TOA albedo. The results obtained with EOS are in line with those of other RT codes running on traditional CPU processors, while being at least one order of magnitude faster. The adoption of OLR and TOA albedo data generated with EOS in a zonal and seasonal climate model correctly reproduce the fluxes of the present-day Earth measured by the CERES spacecraft. The results of this study disclose the possibility to incorporate fast RT calculations in climate models aimed at characterizing the atmospheres of habitable exoplanets.},

The atmosphere models describe the expected temperature-pressure profiles and emergent spectra of atmospheres in radiative-convective equilibrium with effective temperatures and gravities within the ranges \$200{\textbackslash}le T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}{\textbackslash}le2400{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm K\$ and \$2.5{\textbackslash}le {\textbackslash}log g {\textbackslash}le 5.5\$. These ranges encompass masses from about 0.5 to 85 Jupiter masses for a set of metallicities (\$[\{{\textbackslash}rm M/H\}] = -0.5\$ to \$+0.5\$), C/O ratios (from 0.5 to 1.5 times that of solar), and ages. The evolution tables describe the cooling of these substellar objects through time. These models expand the diversity of model atmospheres currently available, notably to cooler effective temperatures and greater ranges in C/O. Notable improvements from past such models include updated opacities and atmospheric chemistry.

	abstract = {We report the first use of Michelson interferometry on the Keck I telescope for diffraction-limited imaging in the near-infrared JHKL bands. By using an aperture mask located close to the f/25 secondary, the 10 m Keck primary mirror was transformed into a separate-element, multiple-aperture interferometer. This has allowed diffraction-limited imaging of a large number of bright astrophysical targets, including the geometrically complex dust envelopes around a number of evolved stars. The successful restoration of these images, with dynamic ranges in excess of 200:1, highlights the significant capabilities of sparse aperture imaging as compared with more conventional filled-pupil speckle imaging for the class of bright targets considered here. In particular, the enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio of the Fourier data, precipitated by the reduction in atmospheric noise, allows high-fidelity imaging of complex sources with small numbers of short-exposure images relative to speckle. Multiepoch measurements confirm the reliability of this imaging technique, and our whole data set provides a powerful demonstration of the capabilities of aperture-masking methods when utilized with the current generation of large-aperture telescopes. The relationship between these new results and recent advances in interferometry and adaptive optics is briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {The high angular resolution technique of non-redundant masking (NRM) or aperture masking interferometry (AMI) has yielded images of faint protoplanetary companions of nearby stars from the ground. AMI on James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)'s Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) has a lower thermal background than ground-based facilities and does not suffer from atmospheric instability. NIRISS AMI images are likely to have 90\%–95\% Strehl ratio between 2.77 and 4.8 μm. In this paper we quantify factors that limit the raw point source contrast of JWST NRM. We develop an analytic model of the NRM point spread function which includes different optical path delays (pistons) between mask holes and fit the model parameters with image plane data. It enables a straightforward way to exclude bad pixels, is suited to limited fields of view, and can incorporate effects such as intra-pixel sensitivity variations. We simulate various sources of noise to estimate their effect on the standard deviation of closure phase, σCP (a proxy for binary point source contrast). If σCP {\textless} 10−4 radians—a contrast ratio of 10 mag—young accreting gas giant planets (e.g., in the nearby Taurus star-forming region) could be imaged with JWST NIRISS. We show the feasibility of using NIRISS' NRM with the sub-Nyquist sampled F277W, which would enable some exoplanet chemistry characterization. In the presence of small piston errors, the dominant sources of closure phase error (depending on pixel sampling, and filter bandwidth) are flat field errors and unmodeled variations in intra-pixel sensitivity. The in-flight stability of NIRISS will determine how well these errors can be calibrated by observing a point source. Our results help develop efficient observing strategies for space-based NRM.},

Despite this abundance, probing the conditions and atmospheric properties on any habitable-zone planet is extremely difficult and has remained elusive to date. Here, we report the detection of water vapor and the likely presence of liquid and icy water clouds in the atmosphere of the 2.6 R ⊕ habitable-zone planet K2-18b. The simultaneous detection of water vapor and clouds in the mid-atmosphere of K2-18b is particularly intriguing because K2-18b receives virtually the same amount of total insolation from its host star ( W m−2) as the Earth receives from the Sun (1361 W m−2), resulting in the right conditions for water vapor to condense and explain the detected clouds. In this study we observed nine transits of K2-18b using Hubble Space Telescope/WFC3 in order to achieve the necessary sensitivity to detect the water vapor, and we supplement this data set with Spitzer and K2 observations to obtain a broader wavelength coverage. While the thick hydrogen-dominated envelope we detect on K2-18b means that the planet is not a true Earth analog, our observations demonstrate that low-mass habitable-zone planets with the right conditions for liquid water are accessible with state-of-the-art telescopes.},

Radial velocity (RV) follow-up with the SPIRou near-infrared high-resolution velocimeter and spectropolarimeter in the framework of the 300-night SPIRou Legacy Survey carried out at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope led to the detection of a Keplerian RV signal with a semi-amplitude of 2306 ± 10 m s-1 in phase with the 14.5 day transit period, with a slight but nonzero eccentricity. The intermediate-mass ratio (M⋆/Mcomp {\textasciitilde} 31) is unique for having such a short separation (0.095 ± 0.001 au) among known M-dwarf systems.

	abstract = {The WISE infrared survey uncovered the coolest sub-stellar objects, brown dwarfs of type "Y", and a precious set of {\textasciitilde}25 Y-dwarfs have been spectroscopically confirmed to date. These brown dwarfs personify the extremes and are the coolest ({\textless}500 K), least massive (5-30 MJup) and, surprisingly, most abundant sub-stellar objects (Kirkpatrick et al. 2019). But Y dwarfs are extremely hard to study from the ground, i.e. they have limited light output below 4 microns and the Earth's atmosphere is opaque near the peak of their spectral energy distribution at 5 microns. Are Y dwarfs single or can they support companions? Is their a minimum companion mass? Can giant planets be formed around Y dwarfs? We propose to unleash JWST's potential by determining the multiplicity rate for a sample of 20 Y-dwarfs with sub Jupiter-mass sensitivity. Using a powerful technique for analyzing NIRCam images, Kernel phase interferometry, we will search for companions with large magnitude differences at sub-AU resolution. We will measure the Y-dwarfs companion-to-host mass ratio distribution, q, to unprecedented low values (q{\textless}0.1), constrain the orbital distribution of companions down to {\textasciitilde}0.5 AU and be sensitive to potential giant planets. We expect an average yield of 3 companions. This survey could discover an object cooler than 250 K, thereby bridging the gap between the coldest known Y dwarf, WISE 0855 (250 K) and Jupiter (130 K). The determination of dynamical masses, vital for advancing our knowledge of Y dwarfs, will be possible within JWST's lifetime. The goals of our observational program can only be achieved with JWST because of its exquisite sensitivity at 5 microns.},

Here we report the detection of 69 μm crystalline olivine feature from the disk using the Spitzer/MIPS-SED data covering 55-95 μm. Due to the low resolution of the MIPS-SED mode, this feature is not spectrally resolved, but is consistent with the emission from crystalline forsterite contributing {\textasciitilde}5\% of the total dust mass. We also present detailed analysis of the disk spectral energy distribution and re-analysis of resolved images obtained by Herschel. Our results suggest that the debris structure around HD 95086 consists of a warm ({\textasciitilde}175 K) belt, a cold ({\textasciitilde}55 K) disk, and an extended disk halo (up to {\textasciitilde}800 AU), and is very similar to that of HR 8799. We compare the properties of the three debris components, and suggest that HD 95086 is a young analog of HR 8799. We further investigate and constrain single-planet, two-planet, three-planet, and four-planet architectures that can account for the observed debris structure and are compatible with dynamical stability constraints. We find that equal-mass four-planet configurations of geometrically spaced orbits, with each planet of mass {\textasciitilde} 5 MJ , could maintain the gap between the warm and cold debris belts, and also be just marginally stable for timescales comparable to the age of the system.},

	abstract = {Context
              . The
              James Webb
              Space Telescope (JWST) will offer high angular resolution observing capability in the near-infrared with masking interferometry on the Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS), and coronagraphic imaging on the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). Full-aperture kernel-phase-based interferometry complements these observing modes by allowing us to probe for companions at small angular resolution while preserving the telescope throughput.
            
            
              Aims
              . Our goal is to derive both theoretical and operational contrast-detection limits for the kernel-phase analysis of JWST NIRISS full-pupil observations using tools from hypothesis testing theory. The study is immediately applied to observations of faint brown dwarfs with this instrument, but the tools and methods introduced here are applicable in a wide variety of contexts.
            
            
              Methods
              . We construct a statistically independent set of observable quantities from a collection of aberration-robust kernel phases. Three detection tests based on these observable quantities are designed and analysed, all having the property of guaranteeing a constant false-alarm rate for phase aberrations smaller than about one radian. One of these tests, the likelihood ratio or Neyman-Pearson test, provides a theoretical performance bound for any detection test.
            
            
              Results
              . The operational detection method considered here is shown to exhibit only marginal power loss with respect to the theoretical bound. In principle, for the test set to a false-alarm probability of 1\%, companions at contrasts reaching 10
              3
              and separations of 200 mas around objects of magnitude 14.1 are detectable with a probability of 68\%. For the brightest objects observable using the full pupil of JWST and NIRISS, contrasts of up to 10
              4
              at separations of 200 mas could ultimately be achieved, barring significant wavefront drift. We also provide a statistical analysis of the uncertainties affecting the contrasts and separations that are estimated for the detected companions.
            
            
              Conclusions
              . The proposed detection method is close to the ultimate bound and offers guarantees on the probability of making a false detection for binaries, as well as on the error bars for the estimated parameters of the binaries that will be detected by JWST NIRISS. This method is not only applicable to JWST NIRISS but to any imaging system with adequate sampling.},

	abstract = {We present preliminary trigonometric parallaxes of 184 late-T and Y dwarfs using observations from Spitzer (143), the U.S. Naval Observatory (18), the New Technology Telescope (14), and the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (9). To complete the 20 pc census of ≥T6 dwarfs, we combine these measurements with previously published trigonometric parallaxes for an additional 44 objects and spectrophotometric distance estimates for another 7. For these 235 objects, we estimate temperatures, sift into five 150 K wide T eff bins covering the range 300-1050 K, determine the completeness limit for each, and compute space densities. To anchor the high-mass end of the brown dwarf mass spectrum, we compile a list of early- to mid-L dwarfs within 20 pc. We run simulations using various functional forms of the mass function passed through two different sets of evolutionary code to compute predicted distributions in T eff. The best fit of these predictions to our L, T, and Y observations is a simple power-law model with α ≈ 0.6 (where \{dN\}/\{dM\}{\textbackslash}propto \{M\}-α ), meaning that the slope of the field substellar mass function is in rough agreement with that found for brown dwarfs in nearby star-forming regions and young clusters. Furthermore, we find that published versions of the log-normal form do not predict the steady rise seen in the space densities from 1050 to 350 K. We also find that the low-mass cutoff to formation, if one exists, is lower than ∼5 M Jup, which corroborates findings in young, nearby moving groups and implies that extremely low-mass objects have been forming over the lifetime of the Milky Way.},

	abstract = {Direct imaging is particularly valuable for characterization of exoplanets: orbits are measured, planet sizes are constrained from brightness measurements, and the planet light can be decomposed in wavelength, polarization state, and time to reveal atmosphere composition and physical properties (pressure, temperature). Images can also reveal multiple planets and map dust distribution to reveal the dynamical evolution and history of exoplanetary systems. Provided that starlight can be canceled with a coronagraph to reduce contamination, the measurements can be of high quality and take full advantage of the sensitivity offered by current and future large ground-based telescopes.Adaptive optics and starlight suppression techniques are essential to deliver the high-contrast imaging performance required for exoplanet imaging. While a few young warm giant planets have been imaged from the ground, the vast majority of exoplanets, including habitable planets, remains beyond current AO systems capabilities. Yet, thanks to rapid ongoing developments in adaptive optics and coronagraphy, and the upcoming generation of 30-m class giant segmented mirror telescopes (GSMTs), direct imaging is poised to reveal and characterize a large number of planets, including nearby habitable planets.},

Radio observations provide unparalleled insight into UCD magnetism: detections extend to brown dwarfs with temperatures {\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}lesssim {\textbackslash})1000 K, where no other observational probes are effective. The data reveal that UCDs can generate strong (kG) fields, sometimes with a stable dipolar structure; that they can produce and retain nonthermal plasmas with electron acceleration extending to MeV energies; and that they can drive auroral current systems resulting in significant atmospheric energy deposition and powerful, coherent radio bursts. Still to be understood are the underlying dynamo processes, the precise means by which particles are accelerated around these objects, the observed diversity of magnetic phenomenologies, and how all of these factors change as the mass of the central object approaches that of Jupiter. The answers to these questions are doubly important because UCDs are both potential exoplanet hosts, as in the TRAPPIST-1 system, and analogues of extrasolar giant planets themselves.},

We distinguish and compare the extent of the various atmospheric compartments that form the atmospheric column, from the troposphere up to the thermosphere. The temperature structure is then presented, and the main causes known for explaining its variations on each body are listed. The specific roles of waves, radiation, as well as convection in shaping temperature profiles are then discussed. In a second part, the particulate components of these atmospheres, clouds and aerosols, are described in terms of their physical properties (composition, optical properties) and of their variability in both space and time. Mars, Venus, and Titan exhibit a remarkable variety of clouds and aerosols. Our knowledge about them has made considerable progress thanks to the success of space missions during the last two decades, while in parallel theoretical models have improved to the point that three-dimensional Global Climate Models now include the detailed physics of clouds and aerosols. As a result, it is now widely recognized that particulates play a key role in forcing the climate and the evolution of these bodies.},

The lithium test has proven to be a very useful tool to distinguish between brown dwarfs and stars and to determine the ages of young open clusters. Young substellar objects show spectral features that are sensitive to surface gravity, which is expected to be lower than in older field counterparts of similar effective temperature. The studies of the substellar mass function indicate that brown dwarfs are very numerous, about one-third of the total number of stars, but their contribution in mass is lower than 10\%. The formation of substellar objects extends below the deuterium-burning mass limit, which is the realm of the so-called free-floating or isolated planetary-mass objects that overlap with the masses of exoplanets.},

In the second section we tackle the detection problem from a data analysis standpoint. We present the most widespread class of algorithms and discuss future improvements.},

	abstract = {Gravitational microlensing is a technique to probe compact objects toward the center of the galaxy, such as distant stars, planets, white and brown dwarfs, black holes, and neutron stars. Since the first microlensing planet discovered in 2003, more than 40 planets have been detected with this technique, as well as several black hole candidates, and a population of potential free-floating planets. This chapter first provides a presentation of the microlensing theory, including numerical aspects to solve binary and triple lens problems, and a discussion of the microlensing planetary detection efficiency, with a high potential regarding cold planets beyond the snow line. It also explains how the planetary characterization can be facilitated when the microlensing light curves exhibit distortions due to second-order effects, such as parallax, planetary orbital motion, and extended source, and how they can also introduce degeneracies in the models. The chapter then reviews the main discoveries to date and the recent statistical results from high-cadence ground-based surveys and space-based observations, especially on the planet mass function and the distance distribution of the microlensing planetary systems. Finally, future prospects are discussed, with the expected advances from dedicated space missions, extending the planet sensitivity range down to Mercury masses.},

Eclipsing binary star systems (EBs) were considered prime targets for the detection of CBP transits, as it was considered likely that the planetary orbits would also be close to edge on to our line of sight and so cross (transit) the stellar discs of the eclipsing stars. The presence of CBPs remained however doubtful until the unequivocal detection, by transit, of Kepler-16b and of further CBPs with the NASA Kepler space telescope.Stellar eclipses were also timed for about a dozen small-mass main-sequence EBs as well. In this chapter we discuss the history of theory and observations in the search for CBPs and the various techniques that have been applied, as well as several methods that might provide results in the future.},

A short overview about the rise of that method to its present status is given. The method’s strength is the rich set of parameters that can be obtained from transiting planets, in particular in combination with radial velocity observations; the basic principles of these parameters are given. The method has however also drawbacks, which are the low probability that transits appear in randomly oriented planet systems and the presence of astrophysical phenomena that may mimic transits and give rise to false detection positives. In the second part, we outline the main factors that determine the design of transit surveys, such as the size of the survey sample, the temporal coverage, the detection precision, the sample brightness and the methods to extract transit events from observed light curves. Lastly, an overview over past, current, and future transit surveys is given. For these surveys we indicate their basic instrument configuration and their planet catch, including the ranges of planet sizes and stellar magnitudes that were encountered. Current and future transit detection experiments concentrate primarily on bright or special targets, and we expect that the transit method remains a principal driver of exoplanet science, through new discoveries to be made and through the development of new generations of instruments.},

	abstract = {The solar system presents us with a number of planetary bodies with shallow atmospheres that are sufficiently Earth-like in their form and structure to be termed “terrestrial.” These atmospheres have much in common, in having circulations that are driven primarily by heating from the Sun and radiative cooling to space, which vary markedly with latitude. The principal response to this forcing is typically in the form of a (roughly zonally symmetric) meridional overturning that transports heat vertically upward and in latitude. But even within the solar system, these planets exhibit many differences in the types of large-scale waves and instabilities that also contribute substantially to determining their respective climates. Here we argue that the study of simplified models (either numerical simulations or laboratory experiments) provides considerable insights into the likely roles of planetary size, rotation, thermal stratification, and other factors in determining the styles of global circulation and dominant waves and instability processes. We discuss the importance of a number of key dimensionless parameters, for example, the thermal Rossby and the Burger numbers as well as nondimensional measures of the frictional or radiative timescales, in defining the type of circulation regime to be expected in a prototypical planetary atmosphere subject to axisymmetric driving. These considerations help to place each of the solar system terrestrial planets into an appropriate dynamical context and also lay the foundations for predicting and understanding the climate and circulation regimes of (as yet undiscovered) Earth-like extrasolar planets. However, as recent discoveries of “super-Earth” planets around some nearby stars are beginning to reveal, this parameter space is likely to be incomplete, and other factors, such as the possibility of tidally locked rotation and tidal forcing, may also need to be taken into account for some classes of extrasolar planet.},

Observations show that these two types of fluid and cold planets differ in their general circulation at cloud level. Jupiter and Saturn are dominated by a jet system that alternates in their direction with latitude, and both possess an intense eastward equatorial jet. On the other hand, Uranus and Neptune show a dominating intense and wide in latitude westward jet symmetric with respect to the equator. In spite of this difference, the four planets present similar atmospheric dynamical phenomena (large-scale vortices, storms, and long waves, among others). Deep convection models have shown that turbulent convection resulting in angular momentum mixing may explain the westward (retrograde) equatorial flow on the ice giants. The jet systems of Jupiter and Saturn have been successfully reproduced using deep convection and shallow forcing models. However, the prograde equatorial flow of the gas giants is more naturally reproduced with deep models or hybrid shallow models incorporating aspects of deeper forcing.},

In a few cases, these data have been used to discover additional planets, similar to the historical discovery of Neptune in our own solar system. However, the more impactful aspect of TTV and TDV studies has been characterization of planetary systems in which multiple planets transit. After addressing the equations of motion and parameter scalings, the main dynamical mechanisms for TTV and TDV are described, with citations to the observational literature for real examples. We describe parameter constraints, particularly the origin of the mass/eccentricity degeneracy and how it is overcome by the high-frequency component of the signal. On the observational side, derivation of timing precision and introduction to the timing diagram are given.

	abstract = {The upper atmospheres of the planets and their satellites are more directly exposed to sunlight and solar-wind particles than the surface or the deeper atmospheric layers. At the altitudes where the associated energy is deposited, the atmospheres may become ionized and are referred to as ionospheres. The details of the photon and particle interactions with the upper atmosphere depend strongly on whether the object has an intrinsic magnetic field that may channel the precipitating particles into the atmosphere or drive the atmospheric gas out to space. Important implications of these interactions include atmospheric loss over diverse timescales, photochemistry, and the formation of aerosols, which affect the evolution, composition, and remote sensing of the planets (satellites). The upper atmosphere connects the planet (satellite) bulk composition to the near-planet (-satellite) environment. Understanding the relevant physics and chemistry provides insight to the past and future conditions of these objects, which is critical for understanding their evolution. This chapter introduces the basic concepts of upper atmospheres and ionospheres in our solar system and discusses aspects of their neutral and ion composition, wind dynamics, and energy budget. This knowledge is key to putting in context the observations of upper atmospheres and haze on exoplanets and to devise a theory that explains exoplanet demographics.},

SPIRou will also efficiently tackle many key programs beyond these two main goals, from weather patterns on brown dwarfs to solar system planet and exoplanet atmospheres. SPIRou will cover a wide spectral domain in a single exposure (0.98–2.44 μm) at a resolving power of 70 K, yielding unpolarized and polarized spectra of low-mass stars with a 15\% average throughput at a radial velocity (RV) precision of 1 m s−1. It consists of a Cassegrain unit mounted at the Cassegrain focus of CFHT and featuring an achromatic polarimeter, coupled to a cryogenic spectrograph cooled down at 80 K through a fluoride fiber link. SPIRou is currently integrated at IRAP/OMP and will be mounted at CFHT in 2018 Q1 for a first light scheduled in early 2018.

	abstract = {Stars form in the Galaxy with a wide range in mass. If the mass is below 7\% of the Sun’s, then the object does not become hot enough for stable hydrogen burning. These substellar objects are called brown dwarfs. Maps of the sky at infrared wavelengths have found large numbers of brown dwarfs. However only 24 objects have been found (as of April 2017) that are cold enough to be classified as “Y dwarfs”: these have atmospheres that are cooler than 500 K (or ∼200∘C, 400∘F) and have masses only 5–20 times that of Jupiter. The coolest Y dwarf currently known, discovered in 2014, has a temperature around freezing, has a mass of about 5 Jupiter masses, and is only 2 pc away from the Sun. These small and cold objects are faint and difficult to find. This chapter describes the discovery and characterization of the Y dwarfs. Finding more of these very cold planet-like brown dwarfs will require an as-yet unplanned space mission mapping large areas of sky at wavelengths around 5 μm.},

It is not possible to understand the strengths of this category of spectrographs without understanding first the revolutionary approach of CORAVEL that set the path for the next generation of instruments using CCDs, i.e., ELODIE and CORALIE. These instruments were extremely successful (e.g., with the discovery of 51 Peg b), it however quickly became clear that higher precision would be necessary in order not to remain stuck with Jupiter- and Saturn-mass planets only. The ELODIE/CORALIE concept was optimized in order to reach best possible performances. This process led to the development of HARPS that has become, through the tens of discoveries of Super-Earths and Neptunes, the new reference for high-precision Doppler velocity measurements. The success of HARPS had to be transposed to the northern hemisphere, an ambition that resulted first in the manufacturing of SOPHIE and later of HARPS-N. This work was finally the baseline for the development of ESPRESSO aiming at the next level of precision. We refer, however, to the chapter dedicated to ESPRESSO in this same handbook for a detailed description.},

Astronomers measure Doppler shifts in the star’s spectral features, which track the line-of-sight gravitational accelerations of a star caused by the planets orbiting it. The method has its roots in binary star astronomy, and exoplanet detection represents the low-companion-mass limit of that application. This limit requires control of several effects of much greater magnitude than the signal sought: the motion of the telescope must be subtracted, the instrument must be calibrated, and spurious Doppler shift “jitter” must be mitigated or corrected. Two primary forms of instrumental calibration are the stable spectrograph and absorption cell methods, the former being the path taken for the next generation of spectrographs. Spurious, apparent Doppler shifts due to non-center-of-mass motion (jitter) can be the result of stellar magnetic activity or photospheric motions and granulation. Several avoidance, mitigation, and correction strategies exist, including careful analysis of line shapes and radial velocity wavelength dependence.},

	abstract = {Nowadays the more powerful method to detect extrasolar planets is the transit method, that is to say observations of the stellar luminosity regularly decreasing when the planet is transiting the star. We review the planet transits which were anticipated and searched and the first ones which were observed all through history.Indeed transits of planets in front of their star were first investigated and studied in the Solar System, concerning the star Sun. The first observations of sunspots were sometimes mistaken for transits of unknown planets. The first scientific observation and study of a transit in the Solar System was the observation of Mercury transit by Pierre Gassendi in 1631. Because observations of Venus transits could give a way to determine the distance Sun-Earth, transits of Venus were overwhelmingly observed. Some objects which actually do not exist were searched by their hypothetical transits on the Sun, as some examples a Venus satellite and an infra-mercurial planet. We evoke the possible first use of the hypothesis of an exoplanet transit to explain some periodic variations of the luminosity of a star, namely, the star Algol, during the eighteenth century.Then we review the predictions of detection of exoplanets by their transits, those predictions being sometimes ancient and made by astronomers as well as popular science writers. However, these very interesting predictions were never published in peer-reviewed journals specialized in astronomical discoveries and results.A possible transit of the planet β Pic b was observed in 1981. Shall we see another transit expected for the same planet during 2018?Nowadays, some studies of transits which are connected to hypothetical extraterrestrial civilizations are published in astronomical peer-reviewed journals. So we can note that the discovery of exoplanets is modiying in the research methods of astronomers. Some studies which would be classified not long ago as science fiction are now considered as scientific ones.},

	abstract = {While recently discovered exotic new planet-types have both challenged our imaginations and broadened our knowledge of planetary system workings, perhaps the most compelling objective of exoplanet science is to detect and characterize habitable and possibly inhabited worlds orbiting in other star systems. For the foreseeable future, characterizations of extrasolar planets will be made via remote sensing of planetary spectroscopic and temporal signals, along with careful fitting of this data to advanced models of planets and their atmospheres. Terrestrial planets are small and significantly more challenging to observe compared to their larger gaseous brethren; however observatories coming on-line in the coming decade will begin to allow their characterization. Still, it is not enough to invest only in observational endeavors. Comprehensive modeling of planetary atmospheres is required in order to fully understand what it is that our grand telescopes see in the night-sky. In our quest to characterize habitable, and possibly inhabited worlds, 3D general circulation models (GCMs) should be used to evaluate potential climate states and their associated temporal and spatial dependent observable signals. 3D models allow for coupled, self-consistent, multi-dimensional simulations, which can realistically simulate the climates of terrestrial extrasolar planets. A complete theoretical understanding of terrestrial exoplanetary atmospheres, gained through comprehensive 3D modeling, is critical for interpreting spectra of exoplanets taken from current and planned instruments, and is critical for designing future missions that aim to measure spectra of potentially habitable exoplanets as one of their key science goals. We recommend continued institutional support for 3D GCM modeling teams that focus on planetary and exoplanetary applications.},

	abstract = {High-resolution spectroscopy (R ≥ 25,000) has recently emerged as one of the leading methods for detecting atomic and molecular species in the atmospheres of exoplanets. However, it has so far been lacking a robust method for extracting quantitative constraints on the temperature structure and molecular/atomic abundances. In this work, we present a novel Bayesian atmospheric retrieval framework applicable to high-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS) that relies on the cross-correlation between data and models to extract the planetary spectral signal. We successfully test the framework on simulated data and show that it can correctly determine Bayesian credibility intervals on atmospheric temperatures and abundances, allowing for a quantitative exploration of the inherent degeneracies. Furthermore, our new framework permits us to trivially combine and explore the synergies between HRCCS and low-resolution spectroscopy to maximally leverage the information contained within each. This framework also allows us to quantitatively assess the impact of molecular line opacities at high resolution. We apply the framework to VLT CRIRES K-band spectra of HD 209458 b and HD 189733 b and retrieve abundant carbon monoxide but subsolar abundances for water, which are largely invariant under different model assumptions. This confirms previous analysis of these data sets, but is possibly at odds with detections of H2O at different wavelengths and spectral resolutions. The framework presented here is the first step toward a true synergy between space observatories and ground-based high-resolution observations.},

	abstract = {Early thinking about detecting extrasolar planets was largely circumscribed by the expectation that other solar systems would be similar to our own, the only known example at the time. Given this mind-set, transit detections were expected to be exceedingly difficult for small planets and rarely seen for larger ones. The discovery of 51 Peg and subsequent hot Jupiters by the radial velocity method completely upended our thinking – transits were suddenly practical, perhaps even easy! This immediately led to follow-up searches for transits in systems discovered by the radial velocity technique and, conversely, to wide-field ground-based transit search programs with radial velocity follow-up observations. As is usually the case, transit work turned out to be harder than initially expected but was still possible and productive. This chapter reviews the circumstances leading to the first transit observations of HD 209458, the early OGLE exoplanets, and TrES-1 and TrES-2, as well as some of the frustrations and difficulties encountered along the way.},

Their atmospheres display chemical species typical of planets, and one could wonder whether they also have weather-like patterns. While brown dwarf surface features cannot be directly resolved, the photometric and spectroscopic modulations induced by these features, as they rotate in and out of view, provide a wealth of information on the evolution of their atmosphere. A review of brown dwarf variability through the L, T, and Y spectral type sequence is presented, as well as the constraints that they set on the nature of weather-like patterns on their surface.},

The impact of exoplanetology on the scientific community as well as on the informed public is presented by several indicators and examples. Currently about 3\% of all refereed articles in astronomy are focused on exoplanets, whereas about a quarter of the science cases for very large multipurpose astronomical instruments is based on exoplanet science. Interactions with the public occur on several levels; we present an overview of exoplanet-related citizen science and discuss the influence of the public’s exposure to media coverage about exoplanets and life in the universe. This influence is changing the public’s perception about the uniqueness of our Earth and about the presence of extraterrestrial life. In turn, this perception affects the public support for the research infrastructure that is necessary to maintain the growth of the field of exoplanetology. Also, an interactive process between exoplanet science and the public through IAU’s NameExoWorlds Contest is presented in detail.},

The lithium test has proven to be a very useful tool to distinguish between brown dwarfs and stars and to determine the ages of young open clusters. Young substellar objects show spectral features that are sensitive to surface gravity, which is expected to be lower than in older field counterparts of similar effective temperature. The studies of the substellar mass function indicate that brown dwarfs are very numerous, about one-third of the total number of stars, but their contribution in mass is lower than 10\%. The formation of substellar objects extends below the deuterium-burning mass limit, which is the realm of the so-called free-floating or isolated planetary-mass objects that overlap with the masses of exoplanets.},

	abstract = {In this chapter, we will deal with the discovery of the first extrasolar planets around normal stars. This discovery took place in the mid-1990s thanks to the analysis of periodic Doppler shifts in stellar spectra and turned out to be a landmark achievement, in that it established a new field of research that is growing at full speed since then, and at the same time, it answered a question – do other worlds exist in the cosmos? – that dates back to ancient times. This major result was made possible by the impressive improvement in Doppler analysis techniques during the second half of the twentieth century, until the precision boosted to values suitable to detect massive planets in close-in orbits. In the late 1980s, two objects came to the limelight: HD 114762 b and γ Cep b. They were suspected to be exoplanets, but it was not possible to rule out alternative explanations, so no undisputable discovery could be claimed. A few years later, in 1995, the discovery of 51 Peg b was announced and confirmed as the first secure one. However, the features of this planet were quite weird as compared to those of the planets of the Solar System, as it was massive and very close to its parent star. Its discovery overturned the previously widespread idea that other systems had to be made like ours and opened the floodgates to the spotting of many other planets. In this chapter, we will tell this story, mainly dwelling upon the historical and epistemological aspects.},

An external companion gravitationally tugs the host star, causing periodic changes in pulsation arrival times. This method is most sensitive to detecting substellar companions around the hottest pulsating stars, especially compact remnants like white dwarfs and hot subdwarfs, as well as δ Scuti variables (A stars). However, it is applicable to any pulsating star with sufficiently stable oscillations. Care must be taken to ensure that the changes in pulsation arrival times are not caused by intrinsic stellar variability; an external, light-travel-time effect from an exoplanet identically affects all pulsation modes. With more long-baseline photometric campaigns coming online, this method is yielding new detections of substellar companions.},

Images can also reveal multiple planets and map dust distribution to reveal the dynamical evolution and history of exoplanetary systems. Provided that starlight can be canceled with a coronagraph to reduce contamination, the measurements can be of high quality and take full advantage of the sensitivity offered by current and future large ground-based telescopes.Adaptive optics and starlight suppression techniques are essential to deliver the high-contrast imaging performance required for exoplanet imaging. While a few young warm giant planets have been imaged from the ground, the vast majority of exoplanets, including habitable planets, remains beyond current AO systems capabilities. Yet, thanks to rapid ongoing developments in adaptive optics and coronagraphy, and the upcoming generation of 30-m class giant segmented mirror telescopes (GSMTs), direct imaging is poised to reveal and characterize a large number of planets, including nearby habitable planets.},

A common sharing of atmospheres is that they are dominantly supported by seasonally varying sublimation/condensation exchanges with the surface. Io’s atmosphere is still fundamentally different from Pluto and Triton in that it presents large horizontal variability. Pluto’s atmosphere, and to a lesser extent Triton’s, are reduced (∼10 μbar class) and colder versions of Titan’s, including in particular a coupled nitrogen-methane chemistry that leads to the production of hydrocarbons, nitriles, and haze. Albeit similar in terms of surface pressure and temperature, Pluto’s and Triton’s atmospheres show marked differences in terms of thermal structure and detailed composition – that are amenable to differences in the ∼20 times smaller atmospheric methane mixing ratio on Triton versus Pluto – itself related to a smaller abundance in the ice phase. Io’s dominantly SO2, nanobar-class atmosphere has immediate support mostly from sublimating surface frost, with a contribution from volcanic plumes. The latter are also important in feeding the atmosphere with nonvolatile gases including SO, S2, NaCl, and KCl. The gas temperature, vertical structure, and dynamics of Io’s atmosphere remain poorly understood.},

Subsequent spacecraft investigations have revealed that many of the planets, and even some moons, either have or have had a planetary-scale magnetic field. In the case of the Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, the magnetic field is generated by dynamo processes within the planet, and an interaction between the solar wind and their magnetic fields generates intense radio emission via the electron cyclotron maser instability. Not only may the radio emissions be a means for discovering extrasolar planets, because magnetic fields are tied to the properties of planetary interiors, radio emissions may be a remote sensing means of constraining extrasolar planetary properties that will be otherwise difficult to access. In the case of terrestrial planets, the presence or absence of a magnetic field may be an indicator for habitability. While no extrasolar planets have yet been detected in the radio, new ground-based telescopes and new possibilities for space-based telescopes provide promise for the near future.},

Their multiplicity and the determination of their physical parameters (effective temperature, gravity, metallicity, and mass) are discussed.

	abstract = {The 2001 discovery of radio emission from ultracool dwarfs (UCDs), the very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs with spectral types of ∼M7 and later, revealed that these objects can generate and dissipate powerful magnetic fields. Radio observations provide unparalleled insight into UCD magnetism: detections extend to brown dwarfs with temperatures {\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}lesssim {\textbackslash})1000 K, where no other observational probes are effective. The data reveal that UCDs can generate strong (kG) fields, sometimes with a stable dipolar structure; that they can produce and retain nonthermal plasmas with electron acceleration extending to MeV energies; and that they can drive auroral current systems resulting in significant atmospheric energy deposition and powerful, coherent radio bursts. Still to be understood are the underlying dynamo processes, the precise means by which particles are accelerated around these objects, the observed diversity of magnetic phenomenologies, and how all of these factors change as the mass of the central object approaches that of Jupiter. The answers to these questions are doubly important because UCDs are both potential exoplanet hosts, as in the TRAPPIST-1 system, and analogues of extrasolar giant planets themselves.},

We here discuss the principles of the observational methods that have been proposed to find moons and rings beyond the solar system, and we review the first searches.

The specific roles of waves, radiation, as well as convection in shaping temperature profiles are then discussed. In a second part, the particulate components of these atmospheres, clouds and aerosols, are described in terms of their physical properties (composition, optical properties) and of their variability in both space and time. Mars, Venus, and Titan exhibit a remarkable variety of clouds and aerosols. Our knowledge about them has made considerable progress thanks to the success of space missions during the last two decades, while in parallel theoretical models have improved to the point that three-dimensional Global Climate Models now include the detailed physics of clouds and aerosols. As a result, it is now widely recognized that particulates play a key role in forcing the climate and the evolution of these bodies.},

	abstract = {The solar system presents us with a number of planetary bodies with shallow atmospheres that are sufficiently Earth-like in their form and structure to be termed “terrestrial.” These atmospheres have much in common, in having circulations that are driven primarily by heating from the Sun and radiative cooling to space, which vary markedly with latitude. The principal response to this forcing is typically in the form of a (roughly zonally symmetric) meridional overturning that transports heat vertically upward and in latitude. But even within the solar system, these planets exhibit many differences in the types of large-scale waves and instabilities that also contribute substantially to determining their respective climates. Here we argue that the study of simplified models (either numerical simulations or laboratory experiments) provides considerable insights into the likely roles of planetary size, rotation, thermal stratification, and other factors in determining the styles of global circulation and dominant waves and instability processes. We discuss the importance of a number of key dimensionless parameters, for example, the thermal Rossby and the Burger numbers as well as nondimensional measures of the frictional or radiative timescales, in defining the type of circulation regime to be expected in a prototypical planetary atmosphere subject to axisymmetric driving. These considerations help to place each of the solar system terrestrial planets into an appropriate dynamical context and also lay the foundations for predicting and understanding the climate and circulation regimes of (as yet undiscovered) Earth-like extrasolar planets. However, as recent discoveries of “super-Earth” planets around some nearby stars are beginning to reveal, this parameter space is likely to be incomplete, and other factors, such as the possibility of tidally locked rotation and tidal forcing, may also need to be taken into account for some classes of extrasolar planet.},

Observations show that these two types of fluid and cold planets differ in their general circulation at cloud level. Jupiter and Saturn are dominated by a jet system that alternates in their direction with latitude, and both possess an intense eastward equatorial jet. On the other hand, Uranus and Neptune show a dominating intense and wide in latitude westward jet symmetric with respect to the equator. In spite of this difference, the four planets present similar atmospheric dynamical phenomena (large-scale vortices, storms, and long waves, among others). Deep convection models have shown that turbulent convection resulting in angular momentum mixing may explain the westward (retrograde) equatorial flow on the ice giants. The jet systems of Jupiter and Saturn have been successfully reproduced using deep convection and shallow forcing models. However, the prograde equatorial flow of the gas giants is more naturally reproduced with deep models or hybrid shallow models incorporating aspects of deeper forcing.},

These instruments were extremely successful (e.g., with the discovery of 51 Peg b), it however quickly became clear that higher precision would be necessary in order not to remain stuck with Jupiter- and Saturn-mass planets only. The ELODIE/CORALIE concept was optimized in order to reach best possible performances. This process led to the development of HARPS that has become, through the tens of discoveries of Super-Earths and Neptunes, the new reference for high-precision Doppler velocity measurements. The success of HARPS had to be transposed to the northern hemisphere, an ambition that resulted first in the manufacturing of SOPHIE and later of HARPS-N. This work was finally the baseline for the development of ESPRESSO aiming at the next level of precision.

However only 24 objects have been found (as of April 2017) that are cold enough to be classified as “Y dwarfs”: these have atmospheres that are cooler than 500 K (or ∼200∘C, 400∘F) and have masses only 5–20 times that of Jupiter.

The method has its roots in binary star astronomy, and exoplanet detection represents the low-companion-mass limit of that application. This limit requires control of several effects of much greater magnitude than the signal sought: the motion of the telescope must be subtracted, the instrument must be calibrated, and spurious Doppler shift “jitter” must be mitigated or corrected. Two primary forms of instrumental calibration are the stable spectrograph and absorption cell methods, the former being the path taken for the next generation of spectrographs. Spurious, apparent Doppler shifts due to non-center-of-mass motion (jitter) can be the result of stellar magnetic activity or photospheric motions and granulation. Several avoidance, mitigation, and correction strategies exist, including careful analysis of line shapes and radial velocity wavelength dependence.},

At the altitudes where the associated energy is deposited, the atmospheres may become ionized and are referred to as ionospheres. The details of the photon and particle interactions with the upper atmosphere depend strongly on whether the object has an intrinsic magnetic field that may channel the precipitating particles into the atmosphere or drive the atmospheric gas out to space. Important implications of these interactions include atmospheric loss over diverse timescales, photochemistry, and the formation of aerosols, which affect the evolution, composition, and remote sensing of the planets (satellites). The upper atmosphere connects the planet (satellite) bulk composition to the near-planet (-satellite) environment. Understanding the relevant physics and chemistry provides insight to the past and future conditions of these objects, which is critical for understanding their evolution. This chapter introduces the basic concepts of upper atmospheres and ionospheres in our solar system and discusses aspects of their neutral and ion composition, wind dynamics, and energy budget. This knowledge is key to putting in context the observations of upper atmospheres and haze on exoplanets and to devise a theory that explains exoplanet demographics.},

Eclipsing binary star systems (EBs) were considered prime targets for the detection of CBP transits, as it was considered likely that the planetary orbits would also be close to edge on to our line of sight and so cross (transit) the stellar discs of the eclipsing stars. The presence of CBPs remained however doubtful until the unequivocal detection, by transit, of Kepler-16b and of further CBPs with the NASA Kepler space telescope.Stellar eclipses were also timed for about a dozen small-mass main-sequence EBs as well. In this chapter we discuss the history of theory and observations in the search for CBPs and the various techniques that have been applied, as well as several methods that might provide results in the future.},

The theory and observations of transit-timing variations (TTVs) and transit duration variations (TDVs) are reviewed. Since the last review, the Kepler spacecraft has detected several hundred perturbed planets. In a few cases, these data have been used to discover additional planets, similar to the historical discovery of Neptune in our own solar system. However, the more impactful aspect of TTV and TDV studies has been characterization of planetary systems in which multiple planets transit. After addressing the equations of motion and parameter scalings, the main dynamical mechanisms for TTV and TDV are described, with citations to the observational literature for real examples. We describe parameter constraints, particularly the origin of the mass/eccentricity degeneracy and how it is overcome by the high-frequency component of the signal. On the observational side, derivation of timing precision and introduction to the timing diagram are given. Science results are reviewed, with an emphasis on mass measurements of transiting sub-Neptunes and super-Earths, from which bulk compositions may be inferred.},

This chapter first provides a presentation of the microlensing theory, including numerical aspects to solve binary and triple lens problems, and a discussion of the microlensing planetary detection efficiency, with a high potential regarding cold planets beyond the snow line. It also explains how the planetary characterization can be facilitated when the microlensing light curves exhibit distortions due to second-order effects, such as parallax, planetary orbital motion, and extended source, and how they can also introduce degeneracies in the models. The chapter then reviews the main discoveries to date and the recent statistical results from high-cadence ground-based surveys and space-based observations, especially on the planet mass function and the distance distribution of the microlensing planetary systems. Finally, future prospects are discussed, with the expected advances from dedicated space missions, extending the planet sensitivity range down to Mercury masses.},

We review the planet transits which were anticipated and searched and the first ones which were observed all through history.Indeed transits of planets in front of their star were first investigated and studied in the Solar System, concerning the star Sun. The first observations of sunspots were sometimes mistaken for transits of unknown planets. The first scientific observation and study of a transit in the Solar System was the observation of Mercury transit by Pierre Gassendi in 1631. Because observations of Venus transits could give a way to determine the distance Sun-Earth, transits of Venus were overwhelmingly observed. Some objects which actually do not exist were searched by their hypothetical transits on the Sun, as some examples a Venus satellite and an infra-mercurial planet. We evoke the possible first use of the hypothesis of an exoplanet transit to explain some periodic variations of the luminosity of a star, namely, the star Algol, during the eighteenth century.Then we review the predictions of detection of exoplanets by their transits, those predictions being sometimes ancient and made by astronomers as well as popular science writers. However, these very interesting predictions were never published in peer-reviewed journals specialized in astronomical discoveries and results.A possible transit of the planet β Pic b was observed in 1981. Shall we see another transit expected for the same planet during 2018?Nowadays, some studies of transits which are connected to hypothetical extraterrestrial civilizations are published in astronomical peer-reviewed journals. So we can note that the discovery of exoplanets is modiying in the research methods of astronomers. Some studies which would be classified not long ago as science fiction are now considered as scientific ones.},

SPIRou will also efficiently tackle many key programs beyond these two main goals, from weather patterns on brown dwarfs to solar system planet and exoplanet atmospheres. SPIRou will cover a wide spectral domain in a single exposure (0.98–2.44 μm) at a resolving power of 70 K, yielding unpolarized and polarized spectra of low-mass stars with a 15\% average throughput at a radial velocity (RV) precision of 1 m s−1. It consists of a Cassegrain unit mounted at the Cassegrain focus of CFHT and featuring an achromatic polarimeter, coupled to a cryogenic spectrograph cooled down at 80 K through a fluoride fiber link. SPIRou is currently integrated at IRAP/OMP and will be mounted at CFHT in 2018 Q1 for a first light scheduled in early 2018.

We model optical stellar spectra as the sum of two input spectra drawn from a vast library of stars throughout the H-R diagram. From typical spectra having a resolution of R = 60,000, we are able to detect companions as faint as 1\% relative to the primary star in approximately the V and R bandpasses of photometry. We are also able to find evidence for triple and quadruple systems, given that any
additional companions are sufficiently bright. The precise threshold percentage depends on the signal-to-noise of the spectrum and the properties of the two stars. For cases of non-detection, we place a limit on the brightness of any potential companions. This algorithm is useful for detecting faint orbiting companions and background stars that are angularly close to a foreground target star. The size of the entrance slit to the spectrometer, 0.87 × 3 arcsec (typically),
sets the angular domain within which the second star can be detected. We analyzed Keck-HIRES spectra of 1160 California Kepler Survey objects of interest (KOI) searching for the secondary spectra, with the two goals of alerting the community to two possible host stars of the transiting planet and to dilution of the light curve. We report 63 California KOI showing spectroscopic evidence of a secondary star.},

Perhaps the most basic parameter of an extrasolar planet is its mass; however, this is very difficult to determine if the planet does not transit the star. The radial velocity technique, still the most fruitful method of discovering planets in the solar neighborhood, can only determine a minimum planet mass. We investigate a method using the near-future IGRINS near infrared
spectrograph to detect the orbital motion of the planet itself. We simulate several observations of a star with an orbiting planet, and search for the spectral signature of the planet by cross-correlating against planet model spectra. A detection appears as a strong peak in the cross-correlation function, and gives the radial velocity of the planet at the time of observation. This, combined with the motion of the star from traditional radial velocity planet search programs, can determine the actual planet mass. We find that the IGRINS instrument can detect the spectral signature from large planets on very close orbits (so-called Hot Jupiters), and that the detections can provide tight constraints on the true planet mass.},

Here I present an improved near-infrared spectrum of this source which further demonstrates the presence of weak CH4 absorption at 1.6 μm but no

It is shown that these features can be collectively reproduced by the combined light spectrum of a binary with L4.5 and T5 components, as deduced by spectral template matching. Thus, SDSS J080531.84+481233.0 appears to be a new low-mass binary straddling the L dwarf/T dwarf transition, an evolutionary phase for brown dwarfs that remains poorly understood by current theoretical models. The case of SDSS J080531.84+481233.0 further illustrates how a select range of L dwarf/T dwarf binaries could be identified and characterized without the need for high angular resolution imaging or radial velocity monitoring, potentially alleviating some of the detection biases and limitations inherent to such techniques.},

	abstract = {Young, intermediate-mass stars are experiencing renewed interest as 
targets for direct-imaging planet searches. However, these types of
stars are part of multiple systems more often than not. Close stellar
companions affect the formation and orbital architecture of planetary
systems, and the properties of the companions can help constrain the
binary formation mechanism. Unfortunately, close companions are
difficult and expensive to detect with imaging techniques. In this
paper, we describe the direct spectral detection method wherein a
high-resolution spectrum of the primary is cross-correlated against a
template for a companion star. Variants of this method have previously
been used to search for stellar, brown dwarf, and even planetary
companions. We show that the direct spectral detection method can detect
companions as late as M-type orbiting A0 or earlier primary stars in a
single epoch on small-aperture telescopes. In addition to estimating the
detection limits, we determine the sources of uncertainty in
characterizing the companion temperature, and find that large systematic
biases can exist. After calibrating the systematic biases with synthetic
binary star observations, we apply the method to a sample of 34 known
binary systems with an A- or B-type primary star. We detect nine total
companions, including four of the five known companions with literature
temperatures between 4000 K {\textbackslash}lt  T{\textbackslash}lt 6000 \{\{K\}\}, the temperature range
for which our method is optimized. We additionally characterize the
companion for the first time in two previously single-lined binary
systems and one binary identified with speckle interferometry. This
method provides an inexpensive way to use small-aperture telescopes to
detect binary companions with moderate mass ratios, and is competitive
with high-resolution imaging techniques inside ∼100-200 mas.},

While binary star detections are generally not the goal of these long-term monitoring efforts, the binary stars hiding in existing planet search data are precisely the type that are too close to the primary star to detect with imaging or interferometry techniques. We use a cross-correlation analysis to detect the spectral lines of a new low-mass companion to ψ1 Draconis A, which has a known roughly equal-mass companion at ∼680 AU. We measure the mass of ψ1 Draconis C as M2 = 0.70 ±
0.07M⊙, with an orbital period of ∼20 years. This
technique could be used to characterize binary companions to many stars that show large-amplitude modulation or linear trends in radial velocity data.},

	abstract = {Binary stars and higher-order multiple systems are a ubiquitous outcome of star formation, especially as the system mass increases. The
companion mass-ratio distribution is a unique probe into the conditions of the collapsing cloud core and circumstellar disk(s) of the binary fragments. Inside a∼ 1000 \{\{A\}\}\{\{U\}\} the disks from the two forming stars can interact, and additionally companions can form directly through disk fragmentation. We should, therefore, expect the mass-ratio distribution of close companions (a≲ 100 AU) to differ from that of wide companions. This prediction is difficult to test using traditional methods, in particular, with intermediate-mass primary stars, for a variety of observational reasons. We present the results of a survey searching for companions to A- and B-type stars using the direct spectral detection method, which is sensitive to late-type companions within ∼ 1{\textbackslash}prime{\textbackslash}prime of the primary and which has no inner working angle. We estimate the temperatures and surface gravity of most of the 341 sample stars and derive their masses and ages. We additionally estimate the temperatures and masses of the 64 companions we find, 23 of which are new detections. We find that the mass-ratio distribution for our sample has a maximum near q∼ 0.3. Our
mass-ratio distribution has a very different form than in previous works, where it is usually well-described by a power law, and indicates that close companions to intermediate-mass stars experience
significantly different accretion histories or formation mechanisms than wide companions.},

with Keplerian orbit fits to the data. This allows us to understand the
detection threshold for each star in terms of the number and time
baseline of the observations, and the underlying “noise”
from measurement errors, intrinsic stellar jitter, or additional
low-mass planets. We show that all planets with orbital periods P {\textless}
2000 days, velocity amplitudes K {\textgreater} 20 m s-1, and
eccentricities e ≲ 0.6 have been announced, and we summarize the
candidates at lower amplitudes and longer orbital periods. For the
remaining stars, we calculate upper limits on the velocity amplitude of
a companion. For orbital periods less than the duration of the
observations, these are typically 10 m s-1 and increase
∝ P2 for longer periods. We then use the nondetections
to derive completeness corrections at low amplitudes and long orbital
periods and discuss the resulting distribution of minimum mass and
orbital period. We give the fraction of stars with a planet as a
function of minimum mass and orbital period and extrapolate to
long-period orbits and low planet masses. A power-law fit for planet
masses {\textgreater}0.3 MJ and periods {\textless} 2000 days gives a

increase in the planet fraction by a factor of ≈5 for orbital periods
≳300 days. Extrapolation gives 17\%-20\% of stars having gas giant

	abstract = {Context. This paper continues a series in which we predict the main 
observable characteristics of exoplanets based on their formation. In
Paper I we described our global planet formation and evolution model
that is based on the core accretion paradigm. In Paper II we studied the
planetary mass-radius relationship with population syntheses. 
Aims: In this paper we present an extensive study of the statistics of
planetary luminosities during both formation and evolution. Our results
can be compared with individual directly imaged extrasolar
(proto)planets and with statistical results from surveys. 
Methods: We calculated three populations of synthetic planets assuming
different efficiencies of the accretional heating by gas and
planetesimals during formation. We describe the temporal evolution of
the planetary mass-luminosity relation. We investigate the relative
importance of the shock and internal luminosity during formation, and
predict a statistical version of the post-formation mass vs. entropy
"tuning fork" diagram. Because the calculations now include deuterium
burning we also update the planetary mass-radius relationship in time.
 Results: We find significant overlap between the high
post-formation luminosities of planets forming with hot and cold gas
accretion because of the core-mass effect. Variations in the individual
formation histories of planets can still lead to a factor 5 to 20 spread
in the post-formation luminosity at a given mass. However, if the gas
accretional heating and planetesimal accretion rate during the runaway
phase is unknown, the post-formation luminosity may exhibit a spread of
as much as 2-3 orders of magnitude at a fixed mass. As a key result we
predict a flat log-luminosity distribution for giant planets, and a
steep increase towards lower luminosities due to the higher occurrence
rate of low-mass (M ≲ 10-40 M⊕) planets. Future
surveys may detect this upturn. Conclusions: Our results indicate
that during formation an estimation of the planetary mass may be
possible for cold gas accretion if the planetary gas accretion rate can
be estimated. If it is unknown whether the planet still accretes gas,
the spread in total luminosity (internal + accretional) at a given mass
may be as large as two orders of magnitude, therefore inhibiting the
mass estimation. Due to the core-mass effect even planets which
underwent cold accretion can have large post-formation entropies and
luminosities, such that alternative formation scenarios such as
gravitational instabilities do not need to be invoked. Once the number
of self-luminous exoplanets with known ages and luminosities increases,
the resulting luminosity distributions may be compared with our
predictions.},

	abstract = {Context. The intrinsic luminosity of young Jupiters is of high interest for planet formation theory. It is an observable quantity that is determined by important physical mechanisms during formation, namely, the structure of the accretion shock and, even more fundamentally, the basic formation mechanism (core accretion or gravitational instability). Aims: Our aim is to study the impact of the core mass on the post-formation entropy and luminosity of young giant planets forming via core accretion with a supercritical accretion shock that radiates all accretion shock energy (cold accretion). Methods: For this, we conduct self-consistently coupled formation and evolution calculations of giant planets with masses between 1 and 12 Jovian masses and core masses between 20 and 120 Earth masses in the 1D spherically symmetric approximation. Results: As the main result, it is found that the post-formation luminosity of massive giant planets is very sensitive to the core mass. An increase in the core mass by a factor 6 results in an increase in the post-formation luminosity of a 10-Jovian mass planet by a factor 120, indicating a dependency as mcore2-3. Due to this dependency, there is no single well-defined post-formation
luminosity for core accretion, but a wide range, even for completely cold accretion. For massive cores ( 100 Earth masses), the
post-formation luminosities of core accretion planets become so high that they approach those in the hot start scenario that is often associated with gravitational instability. For the mechanism to work, it is necessary that the solids are accreted before or during gas runaway accretion and that they sink during this time deep into the planet. Conclusions: We make no claims about whether such massive cores can actually form in giant planets especially at large orbital distances. But if they can form, it becomes difficult to rule out core accretion as the formation mechanism based solely on luminosity for directly imaged planets that are more luminous than predicted for low core masses. Instead of invoking gravitational instability as the consequently necessary formation mode, the high luminosity can also be caused, at least in principle, simply by a more massive core.},

	abstract = {Context: With the high number of extrasolar planets discovered by now, 
it has become possible to use the properties of this planetary
population to constrain theoretical formation models in a statistical
sense. This paper is the first in a series in which we carry out a large
number of planet population synthesis calculations within the framework
of the core accretion scenario. We begin the series with a paper mainly
dedicated to the presentation of our approach, but also the discussion
of a representative synthetic planetary population of solar like stars.
In the second paper we statistically compare the subset of detectable
planets to the actual extrasolar planets. In subsequent papers, we shall
extend the range of stellar masses and the properties of protoplanetary
disks. Aims: The last decade has seen a large observational
progress in characterizing both protoplanetary disks, and extrasolar
planets. Concurrently, progress was made in developing complex
theoretical formation models. The combination of these three
developments allows a new kind of study: the synthesis of a population
of planets from a model, which is compared with the actual population.
Our aim is to obtain a general overview of the population, to check if
we quantitatively reproduce the most important observed properties and
correlations, and to make predictions about the planets that are not yet
observable. Methods: Based as tightly as possible on
observational data, we have derived probability distributions for the
most important initial conditions for the planetary formation process.
We then draw sets of initial conditions from these distributions and
obtain the corresponding synthetic planets with our formation model. By
repeating this step many times, we synthesize the populations. Results: Although the main purpose of this paper is the description of
our methods, we present some key results: we find that the variation of
the initial conditions in the limits occurring in nature leads to the
formation of planets of wide diversity. This formation process is best
visualized in planetary formation tracks in the mass-semimajor axis
diagram, where different phases of concurrent growth and migration can
be identified. These phases lead to the emergence of sub-populations of
planets distinguishable in a mass-semimajor axis diagram. The most
important ones are the “failed cores”, a vast group of
core-dominated low mass planets, the “horizontal branch”, a
sub-population of Neptune mass planets extending out to 6 AU, and the
“main clump”, a concentration of giant gaseous planets at
around 0.3-2 AU.},

This is the first time that a single, uniform spectroscopic analysis has been made for every star on a large Doppler planet search survey. We identify a subset of 850 stars that have Doppler observations sufficient to detect uniformly all planets with radial velocity semiamplitudes K{\textgreater}30 m s-1 and orbital periods shorter than 4 yr. From this subset of stars, we determine that fewer than 3\% of stars with
-0.5{\textless}[Fe/H]{\textless}0.0 have Doppler-detected planets. Above solar
metallicity, there is a smooth and rapid rise in the fraction of stars with planets. At [Fe/H]{\textgreater}+0.3 dex, 25\% of observed stars have detected gas giant planets. A power-law fit to these data relates the formation probability for gas giant planets to the square of the number of metal atoms. High stellar metallicity also appears to be correlated with the presence of multiple-planet systems and with the total detected planet mass. This data set was examined to better understand the origin of high metallicity in stars with planets. None of the expected fossil
signatures of accretion are observed in stars with planets relative to the general sample: (1) metallicity does not appear to increase as the mass of the convective envelopes decreases, (2) subgiants with planets do not show dilution of metallicity, (3) no abundance variations for Na, Si, Ti, or Ni are found as a function of condensation temperature, and (4) no correlations between metallicity and orbital period or
eccentricity could be identified. We conclude that stars with extrasolar planets do not have an accretion signature that distinguishes them from other stars; more likely, they are simply born in higher metallicity molecular clouds.

These data were calculated in two steps. First, the satellite attitude and the astrometric calibration parameters of the CCDs were obtained in an astrometric global iterative solution for 16 million selected sources, using about 1\% of the input data. This primary solution was tied to the extragalactic International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) by means of quasars. The resulting attitude and calibration were then used to calculate the astrometric parameters of all the sources. Special validation solutions were used to characterise the random and systematic errors in parallax and proper motion.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} For the sources with five-parameter astrometric solutions, the median uncertainty in parallax and position at the reference epoch J2015.5 is about 0.04 mas for bright ({\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textless} 14 mag) sources, 0.1 mas at {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 17 mag, and 0.7 masat {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 20 mag.

From the quasars and validation solutions we estimate that systematics in the parallaxes depending on position, magnitude, and colour are generally below 0.1 mas, but the parallaxes are on the whole too small by about 0.03 mas. Significant spatial correlations of up to 0.04 mas in parallax and 0.07 mas yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} in proper motion are seen on small ({\textless} 1 deg) and intermediate (20 deg) angular scales.

	abstract = {As brown dwarfs cool, a variety of species condense in their atmospheres, forming clouds. Iron and silicate clouds shape the emergent spectra of L dwarfs, but these clouds dissipate at the L/T transition. A variety of other condensates are expected to form in cooler T dwarf atmospheres. These include Cr, MnS, Na2S, ZnS, and KCl, but the opacity of these optically thinner clouds has not been included in previous atmosphere models. Here, we examine their effect on model T and Y dwarf atmospheres. The cloud structures and opacities are calculated using the Ackerman \& Marley cloud model, which is coupled to an
atmosphere model to produce atmospheric pressure-temperature profiles in radiative-convective equilibrium. We generate a suite of models between T eff = 400 and 1300 K, log g = 4.0 and 5.5, and condensate sedimentation efficiencies from f sed = 2 to 5. Model spectra are compared to two red T dwarfs, Ross 458C and UGPS 0722-05; models that include clouds are found to match observed spectra significantly better than cloudless models. The emergence of sulfide clouds in cool atmospheres, particularly Na2S, may be a more natural explanation for the "cloudy" spectra of these objects, rather than the reemergence of silicate clouds that wane at the L-to-T transition. We find that sulfide clouds provide a mechanism to match the near- and mid-infrared colors of observed T dwarfs. Our results indicate that including the opacity of condensates in T dwarf atmospheres is necessary to accurately determine the physical characteristics of many of the observed objects.},

sedimentation in horizontally uniform cloud decks. Calculations for the Jovian ammonia cloud are compared with results from previous methods. An adjustable parameter describing the efficiency of sedimentation allows the new model to span the range of predictions made by previous models. Calculations for the Jovian ammonia cloud are consistent with

	abstract = {One of the prime goals of future investigations of extrasolar planets is 
to search for life as we know it. The Earth's biosphere is adapted to
current conditions. How would the atmospheric chemistry of the Earth
respond if we moved it to different orbital distances or changed its
host star? This question is central to astrobiology and aids our
understanding of how the atmospheres of terrestrial planets develop. To
help address this question, we have performed a sensitivity study using
a coupled radiative-convective photochemical column model to calculate
changes in atmospheric chemistry on a planet having Earth's atmospheric
composition, which we subjected to small changes in orbital position, of
the order of 5-10\% for a solar-type G2V, F2V, and K2V star. We then
applied a chemical source-sink analysis to the biomarkers in order to
understand how chemical processes affect biomarker concentrations. We
start with the composition of the present Earth, since this is the only
example we know for which a spectrum of biomarker molecules has been
measured. We then investigate the response of the biomarkers to changes
in the input stellar flux. Computing the thermal profile for atmospheres
rich in H 2O, CO 2 and CH 4 is a major
challenge for current radiative schemes, due, among other things, to
lacking spectroscopic data. Therefore, as a first step, we employ a more
moderate approach, by investigating small shifts in planet-star distance
and assuming an earthlike biosphere. To calculate this shift we assumed
a criteria for complex life based on the Earth, i.e. the earthlike
planetary surface temperature varied between 0 °C{\textless}
Tsurface {\textless}30 °C, which led to a narrow HZ width of
(0.94-1.08) astronomical units (AU) for the solar-type G2V star
(1.55-1.78) AU for the F2V star, and (0.50-0.58) AU for the K2V star. In
our runs we maintained the concentration of atmospheric CO 2
at its present-day level. In reality, the CO 2 cycle (not
presently included in our model) would likely lead to atmospheric CO
2 stabilising at higher levels than considered in our runs
near our quoted "outer" boundaries. The biomarkers H 2O, CH
4 and CH 3Cl varied by factors 0.08, 17, and 16,
respectively in the total column densities on moving outwards for the
solar case. Whereas H 2O decreased moving outwards due to
cooling hence enhanced condensation in the troposphere, CH 4
and CH 3Cl increased associated with a slowing in H
2O+O 1D→2OH, hence less OH, an important sink
for these two compounds. Ozone changes were smaller, around a 10\%
increase on moving outwards partly because cooler temperatures led to a
slowing in the reaction between O 3 and O 1D. We
also considered changes in species which impact ozone - the so-called
family species (and their reservoirs), which can catalytically destroy
ozone. Hydrochloric acid (HCl), for example, is a chlorine reservoir
(storage) molecule, which increased by a factor 64 in the
mid-stratosphere (32 km) on moving outwards for the solar case. For the
F2V and K2V stars, similar sources and sinks dominated the chemical
biomarker budget as for the solar case and column trends were
comparable.},

We consider a wide range of cloudy and cloud-free models. The cloudy models incorporate different geometrical and optical thicknesses, modal particle sizes, and metallicities. For each planet and set of cloud parameters, we explore grids in gravity and effective temperature, with which we determine constraints on the planet’s mass and age. Our new models yield statistically signiﬁcant ﬁts to the data, and conclusively conﬁrm that the HR 8799 planets have much thicker clouds than those required to explain data for typical L and T dwarfs. Both models with (1) physically thick forsterite clouds and a 60 μm modal particle size and (2) clouds made of 1 μm sized pure iron droplets and 1\% supersaturation ﬁt the data. Current data are insufﬁcient to accurately constrain the microscopic cloud properties, such as composition and particle size. The range of bestestimated masses for HR 8799b, HR 8799c, and HR 8799d conservatively span 2–12 MJ, 6–13 MJ, and 3–11 MJ, respectively, and imply coeval ages between ∼10 and ∼150 Myr, consistent with previously reported stellar ages. The best-ﬁt temperatures and gravities are slightly lower than values obtained by Currie et al. using even thicker cloud models. Finally, we use these models to predict the near-to-mid-IR colors of soon-to-be imaged planets. Our models predict that planet-mass objects follow a locus in some near-to-mid-IR color–magnitude diagrams that is clearly separable from the standard L/T dwarf locus for ﬁeld brown dwarfs.},

	abstract = {One of the most profound questions about the newly discovered class of 
low-density super-Earths is whether these exoplanets are predominately
H2-dominated mini-Neptunes or volatile-rich worlds with gas
envelopes dominated by H2O, CO2, CO,
CH4, or N2. Transit observations of the
super-Earth GJ 1214b rule out cloud-free H2-dominated
scenarios, but are not able to determine whether the lack of deep
spectral features is due to high-altitude clouds or the presence of a
high mean molecular mass atmosphere. Here, we demonstrate that one can
unambiguously distinguish between cloudy mini-Neptunes and
volatile-dominated worlds based on wing steepness and relative depths of
absorption features in moderate-resolution near-infrared transmission
spectra (R {\textasciitilde} 100). In a numerical retrieval study, we show for GJ 1214b
that an unambiguous distinction between a cloudy H2-dominated
atmosphere and cloud-free H2O atmosphere will be possible if
the uncertainties in the spectral transit depth measurements can be
reduced by a factor of {\textasciitilde}3 compared to the published Hubble Space
Telescope Wide-Field Camera 3 and Very Large Telescope transit
observations by Berta et al. and Bean et al. We argue that the required
precision for the distinction may be achievable with currently available
instrumentation by stacking 10-15 repeated transit observations. We
provide a scaling law that scales our quantitative results to other
transiting super-Earths and Neptunes such as HD 97658b, 55 Cnc e, GJ
3470b and GJ 436b. The analysis in this work is performed using an
improved version of our Bayesian atmospheric retrieval framework. The
new framework not only constrains the gas composition and cloud/haze
parameters, but also determines our confidence in having detected
molecules and cloud/haze species through Bayesian model comparison.
Using the Bayesian tool, we demonstrate quantitatively that the subtle
transit depth variation in the Berta et al. data is not sufficient to
claim the detection of water absorption.},

Half of our targets are younger than 135 Myr and 90\% are younger than the Hyades (620 Myr). After removing 44 close stellar binaries (implying a stellar companion fraction of {\textgreater}35.4\% ± 4.3\% within 100 AU), 27 of which are new or spatially resolved for the first time, our remaining sample of 78 single M dwarfs makes this the largest imaging search for planets around young low-mass stars (0.1-0.6 M ☉) to date. Our H- and K-band coronagraphic observations with Keck/NIRC2 and Subaru/HiCIAO achieve typical contrasts of 12-14 mag and 9-13 mag at 1″, respectively, which correspond to limiting planet masses of 0.5-10 M Jup at 5-33 AU for 85\% of our sample. We discovered four young brown dwarf companions: 1RXS J235133.3+312720 B (32 ± 6 M Jup; L0; 120 ± 20 AU), GJ 3629 B (64 M Jup; M7.5 ± 0.5; 6.5 ± 0.5 AU), 1RXS J034231.8+121622 B (35 ± 8 M Jup; L0 ± 1; 19.8 ± 0.9 AU), and 2MASS J15594729+4403595 B (43 ± 9 M Jup; M8.0 ± 0.5; 190 ± 20 AU). Over 150 candidate planets were identified; we obtained follow-up imaging for 56\% of these but all are consistent with background stars. Our null detection of planets enables strong statistical constraints on the occurrence rate of long-period giant planets around single M dwarfs. We infer an upper limit (at the 95\% confidence level) of 10.3\% and 16.0\% for 1-13 M Jup planets between 10-100 AU for hot-start and cold-start (Fortney) evolutionary models, respectively. Fewer than 6.0\% (9.9\%) of M dwarfs harbor massive gas giants in the 5-13 M Jup range like those orbiting HR 8799 and β Pictoris between 10-100 AU for a hot-start (cold-start) formation scenario. The frequency of brown dwarf (13-75 M Jup) companions to single M dwarfs between 10-100 AU is 2.8\%. Altogether we find that giant planets, especially massive ones, are rare in the outskirts of M dwarf planetary systems. Although the first directly imaged planets were found around massive stars, there is currently no statistical evidence for a trend of giant planet frequency with stellar host mass at large separations as predicted by the disk instability model of giant planet formation.},

spectrum had been already interpreted as the result of the infall of
small evaporating cometary-like bodies onto the star. To check this
scenario, a model of such an evaporation has been developed, and
subsequent numerical simulations have been carried out. This theoretical
work has highlighted that the suggested scenario reproduces fairly well
the observations, even the drastic difference between the behavior of Ca
II lines on the one hand, and Al III and Mg II ones on the other hand,
which is mainly due to radiation pressure acting differently on these
ions. Assumptions on the evaporation's characteristics and, especially,
on the orbits followed by the infalling bodies have been deduced from
the simulation. These geometrical results suggest that the infalling
objects may come into the star's vicinity from a precise direction.
These rather frequent infalls could be then interpreted as the result of
the perturbing action of an eventual planetary or protoplanetary body
present in the disk on a large amount of small passing-by bodies.},

lines towards beta Pictoris recorded over a period of 3 years and a
smaller set of calcium triplet data. At the present resolution, the
central Ca Ii circumstellar absorption is complex, with several variable
components, some of them at very low velocity shifts ({\textless}10 km s(-1) )
with respect to the star, in addition to a very narrow stable component.
The stable component is analyzed and physical informations are derived.
The variable components at low redshifts are analyzed, and well modeled
in the framework of the Falling Evaporating Bodies (FEB) scenario
previously invoked to explain the absorption features observed at higher
redshifts. We show that the very low redshift events are well simulated
by FEBs crossing the line of sight at somewhat larger distances from the
star than those responsible for the higher velocity redshift events. The
implications of these new observations on the dynamical process
responsible for the FEB phenomenon are discussed. In particular, they
put strong constraints on the orbital parameters of the incoming bodies
that appear in fact in perfect agreement with an origin based on
mean-motion resonances with a massive planet. Based on observations

	abstract = {We present the results of an observational multisite and multiwavelength 
spectroscopic campaign performed in December 1992 on β Pic to test
our Falling Evaporating Body scenario. The unprecedented sampling
obtained enabled us to follow the β Pic variations from the ground
over an 11-day period, and from the ground and space over a 5-day
period. The evolution in terms of velocity and the timescales for
variability are studied, and comparisons are made between various
variable elements (CaII, MnII, FeII, AlIII and AlII). Very significant
activity occurred throughout the campaign. We confirm the existence of
two velocity regimes: low-velocity, slowly variable lines, and
high-velocity, rapidly variable ones. It is shown that the higher the
redshift, the smaller the variability timescale, the smaller the filling
factors of the absorbing clouds, and the wider the lines. We detect for
the first time the local effect of stellar rotation described by Beust
\& Lissauer (1994), which enables us to infer the location of the
projection of the infalling absorbing cloud on the stellar surface. The
variability of FeII appears to be correlated with that of CaII.
Conversely, AlIII variability is not correlated with that of CaII. The
observed evolution and characteristics of the high-velocity events
appear to be well explained by the evaporation of one single body The
evolution of the low-velocity variable events cannot be reproduced by
the evaporation of one single body, but rather by a family of bodies on
adjacent orbits.},

	abstract = {The disk surrounding Beta Pictoris has been imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope Planetary Camera in the four photometric filters centered near 439, 555, 675 and 814 nm, and at a total of four different spacecraft roll angles. After masking the images to exclude the disk region, a composite PSF was constructed that enabled us to generate three
statistically independent images of the disk for each filter. The images show the disk in reflected light from a radius of about 1.5 arcseconds to about 10 arcseconds. We have developed a full three dimensional simulation of the disk which reproduces the observed scattered light distribution and the known infrared photometry and direct imaging from IRAS and previous ground based investigations in a self-consistent manner. By least squares fitting all of the data we are able to derive geometric parameters of the disk and constrain the optical properties of its particles. The scattering is well described by small particles with a visible albedo of around 0.4 and a small scattering phase function variation. The inclination of the disk axis to the plane of the sky is only of order 1 degree. There is a relatively clear zone in the disk with the normal optical depth decreasing linearly within 40 AU from the star from a constant value of 0.005 between 40 and 100 AU. We find that the scale height of the disk is roughly constant within the inner 100 AU, while the outer disk has a linear scale height power law consistent with previous investigations. The disk density is not Gaussian in cross section, as might be expected for a Maxwellian distribution of similar particles, but exponential. We do not interpret this as evidence for pressure support, but rather as evidence for a particle mass spectrum. Several previously reported north-south disk asymmetries are evident in the data, but a significant new result is a rotationally symmetric warp in the inner disk. Detailed dynamical simulations based on the observed mass distribution and with an appropriate collisional viscosity show that this warp is not sustainable in the disk for more than 1 Myr, which is very small compared to the probable age of the system and its collisional timescale with other stars. We conclude that it is likely that at least one massive substellar companion in an inclined orbit to the star is responsible for maintaining the warp. This companion may also be responsible for stirring up the disk within 100 AU and
generating the clearer zone within 40 AU.},

Joint analysis of resolved imaging from Keck Observatory and Hubble Space Telescope and unresolved astrometry from CFHT/WIRCam yields parallactic distances for all systems, robust orbit determinations for 23 systems, and photocenter orbits for 19 systems. As a result, we measure 38 precise individual masses spanning 30–115 . We determine a model-independent substellar boundary that is ≈70 in mass (≈L4 in spectral type), and we validate Baraffe et al. evolutionary model predictions for the lithium-depletion boundary (60 at field ages). Assuming each binary is coeval, we test models of the substellar mass–luminosity relation and find that in the L/T transition, only the Saumon \& Marley “hybrid” models accounting for cloud clearing match our data. We derive a precise, mass-calibrated spectral type–effective temperature relation covering 1100–2800 K. Our masses enable a novel direct determination of the age distribution of field brown dwarfs spanning L4–T5 and 30–70 . We determine a median age of 1.3 Gyr, and our population synthesis modeling indicates our sample is consistent with a constant star formation history modulated by dynamical heating in the Galactic disk. We discover two triple-brown-dwarf systems, the first with directly measured masses and eccentricities. We examine the eccentricity distribution, carefully considering biases and completeness, and find that low-eccentricity orbits are significantly more common among ultracool binaries than solar-type binaries, possibly indicating the early influence of long-lived dissipative gas disks. Overall, this work represents a major advance in the empirical view of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.},

Comparing to theoretical isochrones, we find good agreement for the measured masses and JHK band magnitudes of the two components consistent with the age of the β Pic moving group. We derive a model-dependent age for the β Pic moving group of 26 ± 3 Myr by combining our results for V343 Normae with literature measurements for GJ 3305, which is another group member with resolved binary components and dynamical masses.},

	abstract = {A crucial diagnostic that can tell us about processes involved in the formation and dynamical evolutionof planetary systems is the angle between the rotation axis of a star and a planet's orbital angular momentum vector ("spin-orbit" alignment or "obliquity"). Here we present the first spin-orbit alignment measurement for a wide-separation exoplanetary system, namely on the directly-imaged planet \${\textbackslash}beta\$ Pictoris b. We use VLTI/GRAVITY spectro-interferometry with an astrometric accuracy of 1 \${\textbackslash}mu\$as (microarcsecond) in the Br\${\textbackslash}gamma\$ photospheric absorption line to measure the photocenter displacement associated with the stellar rotation. Taking inclination constraints from astroseismology into account, we constrain the 3-dimensional orientation of the stellar spin axis and find that \${\textbackslash}beta\$ Pic b orbits its host star on a prograde orbit. The angular momentum vectors of the stellar photosphere, the planet, and the outer debris disk are well-aligned with mutual inclinations \${\textless}3{\textbackslash}pm5{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$, which indicates that \${\textbackslash}beta\$ Pic b formed in a system without significant primordial misalignments. Our results demonstrate the potential of infrared interferometry to measure the spin-orbit alignment for wide-separation planetary systems, probing a highly complementary regime to the parameter space accessible with the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. If the low obliquity is confirmed by measurements on a larger sample of wide-separation planets, it would lend support to theories that explain the obliquity in Hot Jupiter systems with dynamical scattering and the Kozai-Lidov mechanism.},

Comparison of these models with observations in various colour-magnitude diagrams for various ages shows significant improvement over previous generations of models. The new models can solve flaws that are present in the previous ones, such as the prediction of optical colours that are too blue compared to M dwarf observations. They can also reproduce the four components of the young quadruple system LkCa 3 in a colour–magnitude diagram with one single isochrone, in contrast to any presently existing model. In this paper we also highlight the need for consistency when comparing models and observations, with the necessity of using evolutionary models and colours based on the same atmospheric structures.},

We analyze the mid-IR colors of cluster members and compared their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to star+circumstellar disk models to constrain the disk morphologies and evolutionary states. Early/intermediate-type confirmed/candidate cluster members either have photospheric mid-IR emission or weak, optically thin IR excess emission at λ ⩾ 24 μm consistent with debris disks. Few late-type, solar/subsolar-mass stars have primordial disks. The disk population around late-type stars is dominated by disks with inner holes (canonical “transition disks”) and “homologously depleted” disks. Both types of disks represent an intermediate stage between primordial disks and debris disks. Thus, in agreement with previous results, we find that multiple paths for the primordial-to-debris disk transition exist. Because these “evolved primordial disks” greatly outnumber primordial disks, our results undermine standard arguments in favor of a ≲105 yr timescale for the transition based on data from Taurus-Auriga. Because the typical transition timescale is far longer than 105 yr, these data also appear to rule out standard ultraviolet photoevaporation scenarios as the primary mechanism to explain the transition. Combining our data with other Spitzer surveys, we investigate the evolution of debris disks around high/intermediate-mass stars and investigate timescales for giant planet formation. Consistent with Currie et al., the luminosity of 24 μm emission in debris disks due to planet formation peaks at ≈10-20 Myr. If the gas and dust in disks evolve on similar timescales, the formation timescale for gas giant planets surrounding early-type, high/intermediate-mass (≳1.4 M ☉) stars is likely 1-5 Myr. Most solar/subsolar-mass stars detected by Spitzer have SEDs that indicate their disks may be actively leaving the primordial disk phase. Thus, gas giant planet formation may also occur by ∼5 Myr around solar/subsolar-mass stars as well.},

To remove systematic errors from the spectral energy distribution (SED), we re-calibrate the literature photometry and combine it with our own data, for a total of 22 independent measurements at 16 passbands from 0.99 to 4.8 μm. Atmosphere models demonstrate the planet is cloudy but are degenerate in effective temperature and radius.

	abstract = {The current and upcoming high precision photometric surveys such as TESS, CHEOPS, and PLATO will provide the community with thousands of new exoplanet candidates. As a consequence, the presence of such a correlation is crucial in selecting the targets with the lowest RV jitter for efficient RV follow-up of exoplanetary candidates. Studies of this type are also crucial to design optimized observational strategies to mitigate RV jitter when searching for Earth-mass exoplanets. Our goal is to assess the correlation between high-precision photometric variability measurements and high-precision RV jitter over different time scales. We analyze 171 G, K, and M stars with available TESS high precision photometric time-series and HARPS precise RVs. We derived the stellar parameters for the stars in our sample and measured the RV jitter and photometric variability. We also estimated chromospheric Ca II H \${\textbackslash}\&\$ K activity indicator \$log(R' \_\{HK\})\$, \${\textbackslash}textit\{v sin i\}\$, and the stellar rotational period. Finally, we evaluate how different stellar parameters and a RV sampling subset can have an impact on the potential correlations. We find a varying correlation between the photometric variability and RV jitter as function of time intervals between the TESS photometric observation and HARPS RV. As the time intervals of the observations considered for the analysis increases, the correlation value and significance becomes smaller and weaker, to the point that it becomes negligible. We also find that for stars with a photometric variability above 6.5 ppt the correlation is significantly stronger. We show that such a result can be due to the transition between the spot-dominated and the faculae-dominated regime. We quantified the correlations and updated the relationship between chromospheric Ca II H \${\textbackslash}\&\$ K activity indicator \$log(R' \_\{HK\})\$ and RV jitter.},

	abstract = {We estimate disc-averaged RV variations of the Sun over the last magnetic cycle, from the single Fe I line observed by SDO/HMI, using a physical model for rotationally modulated magnetic activity that was previously validated against HARPS-N solar observations. We estimate the disc-averaged, unsigned magnetic flux and show that a simple linear fit to it reduces the RMS of RV variations by 62\%, i.e. a factor of 2.6. We additionally apply the FF' method, which predicts RV variations based on a star's photometric variations. At cycle maximum, we find that additional physical processes must be at play beyond suppression of convective blueshift and velocity imablances resulting from brightness inhomogeneities, in agreement with recent studies of solar RV variations. By modelling RV variations over the magnetic cycle using a linear fit to the unsigned magnetic flux, we recover injected planets at an orbital period of about 300 days with RV semi-amplitudes down to 0.3 m/s. To reach semi-amplitudes of 0.1 m/s, we will need to identify and model additional physical phenomena that are not well traced by the unsigned magnetic flux or FF'. The unsigned magnetic flux is an excellent proxy for rotationally modulated, activity-induced RV variations, and could become a key tool in confirming and characterising Earth analogs orbiting Sun-like stars. The present study motivates ongoing and future efforts to develop observation and analysis techniques to measure the unsigned magnetic flux at high precision in slowly rotating, relatively inactive stars like the Sun.},

	abstract = {We aim to confirm the presence of Proxima b using independent measurements obtained with the new ESPRESSO spectrograph, and refine the planetary parameters taking advantage of its improved precision. We analysed 63 spectroscopic ESPRESSO observations of Proxima taken during 2019. We obtained radial velocity measurements with a typical radial velocity photon noise of 26 cm/s. We ran a joint MCMC analysis on the time series of the radial velocity and full-width half maximum of the cross-correlation function to model the planetary and stellar signals present in the data, applying Gaussian process regression to deal with stellar activity. We confirm the presence of Proxima b independently in the ESPRESSO data. The ESPRESSO data on its own shows Proxima b at a period of 11.218 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.029 days, with a minimum mass of 1.29 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.13 Me. In the combined dataset we measure a period of 11.18427 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.00070 days with a minimum mass of 1.173 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.086 Me. We find no evidence of stellar activity as a potential cause for the 11.2 days signal. We find some evidence for the presence of a second short-period signal, at 5.15 days with a semi-amplitude of merely 40 cm/s. If caused by a planetary companion, it would correspond to a minimum mass of 0.29 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.08 Me. We find that the FWHM of the CCF can be used as a proxy for the brightness changes and that its gradient with time can be used to successfully detrend the radial velocity data from part of the influence of stellar activity. The activity-induced radial velocity signal in the ESPRESSO data shows a trend in amplitude towards redder wavelengths. Velocities measured using the red end of the spectrograph are less affected by activity, suggesting that the stellar activity is spot-dominated. The data collected excludes the presence of extra companions with masses above 0.6 Me at periods shorter than 50 days.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10105},
	abstract = {The current and upcoming high precision photometric surveys such as TESS, CHEOPS, and PLATO will provide the community with thousands of new exoplanet candidates. As a consequence, the presence of such a correlation is crucial in selecting the targets with the lowest RV jitter for efficient RV follow-up of exoplanetary candidates. Studies of this type are also crucial to design optimized observational strategies to mitigate RV jitter when searching for Earth-mass exoplanets. Our goal is to assess the correlation between high-precision photometric variability measurements and high-precision RV jitter over different time scales. We analyze 171 G, K, and M stars with available TESS high precision photometric time-series and HARPS precise RVs. We derived the stellar parameters for the stars in our sample and measured the RV jitter and photometric variability. We also estimated chromospheric Ca II H \${\textbackslash}\&\$ K activity indicator \$log(R' \_\{HK\})\$, \${\textbackslash}textit\{v sin i\}\$, and the stellar rotational period. Finally, we evaluate how different stellar parameters and a RV sampling subset can have an impact on the potential correlations. We find a varying correlation between the photometric variability and RV jitter as function of time intervals between the TESS photometric observation and HARPS RV. As the time intervals of the observations considered for the analysis increases, the correlation value and significance becomes smaller and weaker, to the point that it becomes negligible. We also find that for stars with a photometric variability above 6.5 ppt the correlation is significantly stronger. We show that such a result can be due to the transition between the spot-dominated and the faculae-dominated regime. We quantified the correlations and updated the relationship between chromospheric Ca II H \${\textbackslash}\&\$ K activity indicator \$log(R' \_\{HK\})\$ and RV jitter.},

Our implementation of this method, Orbits for the Impatient (OFTI), converges up to several orders of magnitude faster than two implementations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in this regime. We illustrate the efficiency of our approach by showing that OFTI calculates accurate posteriors for all existing astrometry of the exoplanet 51 Eri b up to 100 times faster than a Metropolis–Hastings MCMC. We demonstrate the accuracy of OFTI by comparing our results for several orbiting systems with those of various MCMC implementations, finding the output posteriors to be identical within shot noise. We also describe how our algorithm was used to successfully predict the location of 51 Eri b six months in the future based on less than three months of astrometry. Finally, we apply OFTI to 10 long-period exoplanets and brown dwarfs, all but one of which have been monitored over less than 3\% of their orbits, producing fits to their orbits from astrometric records in the literature.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textless}i{\textgreater}β{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Pictoris is arguably one of the most studied stellar systems outside of our own. Some 30 yr of observations have revealed a highly-structured circumstellar disk, with rings, belts, and a giant planet: {\textless}i{\textgreater}β{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Pictoris b. However very little is known about how this system came into being.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Our objective is to estimate the C/O ratio in the atmosphere of {\textless}i{\textgreater}β{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Pictoris b and obtain an estimate of the dynamical mass of the planet, as well as to refine its orbital parameters using high-precision astrometry.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We used the GRAVITY instrument with the four 8.2 m telescopes of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer to obtain {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-band spectro-interferometric data on {\textless}i{\textgreater}β{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Pic b. We extracted a medium resolution ({\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 500) {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-band spectrum of the planet and a high-precision astrometric position. We estimated the planetary C/O ratio using two different approaches (forward modeling and free retrieval) from two different codes (ExoREM and petitRADTRANS, respectively). Finally, we used a simplified model of two formation scenarios (gravitational collapse and core-accretion) to determine which can best explain the measured C/O ratio.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Our new astrometry disfavors a circular orbit for {\textless}i{\textgreater}β{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Pic b ( ). Combined with previous results and with HIPPARCOS/{\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} measurements, this astrometry points to a planet mass of {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 12.7 ± 2.2 {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. This value is compatible with the mass derived with the free-retrieval code petitRADTRANS using spectral data only. The forward modeling and free-retrieval approches yield very similar results regarding the atmosphere of {\textless}i{\textgreater}β{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Pic b. In particular, the C/O ratios derived with the two codes are identical (0.43 ± 0.05 vs. ). We argue that if the stellar C/O in {\textless}i{\textgreater}β{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Pic is Solar, then this combination of a very high mass and a low C/O ratio for the planet suggests a formation through core-accretion, with strong planetesimal enrichment.},

This, in turn, allows for the computation of the giant planet occurrence rates at all separations. The RV search around young stars is a challenge as they are generally faster rotators than older stars of similar spectral types and they exhibit signatures of magnetic activity (spots) or pulsation in their RV time series. Specific analyses are necessary to characterize, and possibly correct for, this activity.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Our aim is to search for planets around young nearby stars and to estimate the giant planet (GP) occurrence rates for periods up to 1000 days.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We used the HARPS spectrograph on the 3.6 m telescope at La Silla Observatory to observe 89 {\textless}i{\textgreater}A{\textless}i/{\textgreater}−{\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater} young ({\textless}600 Myr) stars.

	abstract = {Based on two decades of radial velocity (RV) observations using Keck/High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) and McDonald/Tull, and more recent observations using the Automated Planet Finder, we found that the nearby star HR 5183 (HD 120066) hosts a 3 minimum mass planet with an orbital period of yr. The orbit is highly eccentric (e ≃ 0.84), shuttling the planet from within the orbit of Jupiter to beyond the orbit of Neptune. Our careful survey design enabled high cadence observations before, during, and after the planet’s periastron passage, yielding precise orbital parameter constraints. We searched for stellar or planetary companions that could have excited the planet’s eccentricity, but found no candidates, potentially implying that the perturber was ejected from the system. We did identify a bound stellar companion more than 15,000 au from the primary, but reasoned that it is currently too widely separated to have an appreciable effect on HR 5183 b. Because HR 5183 b’s wide orbit takes it more than 30 au (1″) from its star, we also explored the potential of complimentary studies with direct imaging or stellar astrometry. We found that a Gaia detection is very likely, and that imaging at 10 μm is a promising avenue. This discovery highlights the value of long-baseline RV surveys for discovering and characterizing long-period, eccentric Jovian planets. This population may offer important insights into the dynamical evolution of planetary systems containing multiple massive planets.},

It relies on identifying sequences of pulsation modes that can be compared with theoretical models, which has been done successfully for many classes of pulsators, including low-mass solar-type stars2, red giants3, high-mass stars4 and white dwarfs5. However, a large group of pulsating stars of intermediate mass—the so-called δ Scuti stars—have rich pulsation spectra for which systematic mode identification has not hitherto been possible6,7. This arises because only a seemingly random subset of possible modes are excited and because rapid rotation tends to spoil regular patterns8–10. Here we report the detection of remarkably regular sequences of high-frequency pulsation modes in 60 intermediate-mass main-sequence stars, which enables definitive mode identification. The space motions of some of these stars indicate that they are members of known associations of young stars, as confirmed by modelling of their pulsation spectra.},

The analysis of photometric data and spectro-scopic activity diagnostics does not explain the signal in terms of a stellar activity cycle, but follow-up is required in the coming years for confirming its planetary origin. We show that the existence of the planet can be ascertained, and its true mass can be determined with high accuracy, by combining Gaia astrometry and radial velocities. Proxima c could become a prime target for follow-up and characterization with next-generation direct imaging instrumentation due to the large maximum angular separation of {\textasciitilde}1 arc second from the parent star. The candidate planet represents a challenge for the models of super-Earth formation and evolution.
Proxima could host a planet on a ∼5-year orbit, which Gaia can confirm in the near future providing its exact mass.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06685},
	abstract = {Proxima Centauri is known to host an earth-like planet in its habitable zone; very recently a second candidate planet was proposed based on radial velocities. At quadrature, the expected projected separation of this new candidate is larger than 1 arcsec, making it a potentially interesting target for direct imaging. While difficult, identification of the optical counterpart of this planet would allow detailed characterization of the closest planetary system. We searched for a counterpart in SPHERE images acquired during four years through the SHINE survey. In order to account for the large orbital motion of the planet, we used a method that assumes the circular orbit obtained from radial velocities and exploits the sequence of observations acquired close to quadrature in the orbit. We checked this with a more general approach that considers keplerian motion, K-stacker. We did not obtain a clear detection. The best candidate has S/N=6.1 in the combined image. A statistical test suggests that the probability that this detection is due to random fluctuation of noise is {\textless} 1\% but this result depends on the assumption that distribution of noise is uniform over the image. The position of this candidate and the orientation of its orbital plane fit well with observations in the ALMA 12m array image. However, the astrometric signal expected from the orbit of the candidate we detected is 3-sigma away from the astrometric motion of Proxima as measured from early Gaia data. This, together with the unexpectedly high flux associated with our direct imaging detection, means we cannot confirm that our candidate is indeed Proxima c. On the other hand, if confirmed, this would be the first observation in imaging of a planet discovered from radial velocities and the second one (after Fomalhaut b) of reflecting circumplanetary material. Further confirmation observations should be done as soon as possible.},

	abstract = {A number of problems in probability and statistics can be addressed using the multivariate normal (Gaussian) distribution. In the one-dimensional case, computing the probability for a given mean and variance simply requires the evaluation of the corresponding Gaussian density. In the n-dimensional setting, however, it requires the inversion of an n x n covariance matrix, C, as well as the evaluation of its determinant, det(C). In many cases, such as regression using Gaussian processes, the covariance matrix is of the form C = σ2I + K, where K is computed using a specified covariance kernel which depends on the data and additional parameters (hyperparameters). The matrix C is typically dense, causing standard direct methods for inversion and determinant evaluation to require O(n3) work. This cost is prohibitive for large-scale modeling. Here, we show that for the most commonly used covariance functions, the matrix C can be hierarchically factored into a product of block low-rank updates of the identity matrix, yielding an O(n log2 n) algorithm for inversion. More importantly, we show that this factorization enables the evaluation of the determinant det(C), permitting the direct calculation of probabilities in high dimensions under fairly broad assumptions on the kernel defining K. Our fast algorithm brings many problems in marginalization and the adaptation of hyperparameters within practical reach using a single CPU core. The combination of nearly optimal scaling in terms of problem size with high-performance computing resources will permit the modeling of previously intractable problems. We illustrate the performance of the scheme on standard covariance kernels.},

The validated planet HIP 67522 b is currently the youngest transiting hot Jupiter discovered and is an ideal candidate for transmission spectroscopy and radial velocity follow-up studies, while also demonstrating that some young giant planets either form in situ at small orbital radii, or else migrate promptly from formation sites farther out in the disk.},

	abstract = {We present deep Hubble Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph coronagraphic images of the β Pic debris disk obtained at two epochs separated by 15 yr. The new images and the re-reduction of the 1997 data provide the most sensitive and detailed views of the disk at optical wavelengths as well as the yet smallest inner working angle optical coronagraphic image of the disk. Our observations characterize the large-scale and inner-disk asymmetries and we identify multiple breaks in the disk radial surface brightness profile. We study in detail the radial and vertical disk structure and show that the disk is warped. We explore the disk at the location of the β Pic b super-Jupiter and find that the disk surface brightness slope is continuous between 0.″5 and 2.″0, arguing for no change at the separations where β Pic b orbits. The two epoch images constrain the disk's surface brightness evolution on orbital and radiation pressure blow-out timescales. We place an upper limit of 3\% on the disk surface brightness change between 3″ and 5″, including the locations of the disk warp, and the CO and dust clumps. We discuss the new observations in the context of high-resolution multi-wavelength images and divide the disk asymmetries in two groups: axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric. The axisymmetric structures (warp, large-scale butterfly, etc.) are consistent with disk structure models that include interactions of a planetesimal belt and a non-coplanar giant planet. The non-axisymmetric features, however, require a different explanation.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Ground-based high-dispersion ({\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 100 000) spectroscopy (HDS) is proving to be a powerful technique with which to characterize extrasolar planets. The planet signal is distilled from the bright starlight, combining ral and time-differential filtering techniques. In parallel, high-contrast imaging (HCI) is developing rapidly, aimed at spatially separating the planet from the star. While HDS is limited by the overwhelming noise from the host star, HCI is limited by residual quasi-static speckles. Both techniques currently reach planet-star contrast limits down to {\textasciitilde}10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-5{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}, albeit for very different types of planetary systems.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}In this work, we discuss a way to combine HDS and HCI (HDS+HCI). For a planet located at a resolvable angular distance from its host star, the starlight can be reduced up to several orders of magnitude using adaptive optics and/or coronography. In addition, the remaining starlight can be filtered out using high-dispersion spectroscopy, utilizing the significantly different (or Doppler shifted) high-dispersion spectra of the planet and star. In this way, HDS+HCI can {\textless}i{\textgreater}in principle {\textless}i/{\textgreater}reach contrast limits of {\textasciitilde}10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-5{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} × 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-5{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}, although in practice this will be limited by photon noise and/or sky-background. In contrast to current direct imaging techniques, such as Angular Differential Imaging and Spectral Differential Imaging, it will work well at small working angles and is much less sensitive to speckle noise. For the discovery of previously unknown planets HDS+HCI requires a high-contrast adaptive optics system combined with a high-dispersion {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 100 000 integral field spectrograph (IFS). This combination currently does not exist, but is planned for the European Extremely Large Telescope.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We present simulations of HDS+HCI observations with the E-ELT, both probing thermal emission from a planet at infrared wavelengths, and starlight reflected off a planet atmosphere at optical wavelengths. For the infrared simulations we use the baseline parameters of the E-ELT and METIS instrument, with the latter combining extreme adaptive optics with an {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 100 000 IFS. We include realistic models of the adaptive optics performance and atmospheric transmission and emission. For the optical simulation we also assume {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 100 000 IFS with adaptive optics capabilities at the E-ELT.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}One night of HDS+HCI observations with the E-ELT at 4.8 {\textless}i{\textgreater}μ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}m (Δ{\textless}i{\textgreater}λ{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 0.07 {\textless}i{\textgreater}μ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}m) can detect a planet orbiting {\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Cen A with a radius of {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 1.5 {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}earth{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and a twin-Earth thermal spectrum of {\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}eq{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 300 K at a signal-to-noise (S/N) of 5. In the optical, with a Strehl ratio performance of 0.3, reflected light from an Earth-size planet in the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri can be detected at a S/N of 10 in the same time frame. Recently, first HDS+HCI observations have shown the potential of this technique by determining the spin-rotation of the young massive exoplanet {\textless}i{\textgreater}β{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Pictoris b.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}The exploration of the planetary systems of our neighbor stars is of great scientific and philosophical value. The HDS+HCI technique has the potential to detect and characterize temperate rocky planets in their habitable zones. Exoplanet scientists should not shy away from claiming a significant fraction of the future ELTs to make such observations possible.},

	abstract = {The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has a goal of detecting small planets orbiting stars bright enough for mass determination via ground-based radial velocity observations. Here, we present estimates of how many exoplanets the TESS mission will detect, the physical properties of the detected planets, and the properties of the stars that those planets orbit. This work uses stars drawn from the TESS Input Catalog Candidate Target List and revises yields from prior studies that were based on Galactic models. We modeled the TESS observing strategy to select approximately 200,000 stars at 2-minute cadence, while the remaining stars are observed at 30-minute cadence in full-frame image data. We placed zero or more planets in orbit around each star, with physical properties following measured exoplanet occurrence rates, and used the TESS noise model to predict the derived properties of the detected exoplanets. In the TESS 2-minute cadence mode we estimate that TESS will find 1250 ± 70 exoplanets (90\% confidence), including 250 smaller than 2 R ⊕. Furthermore, we predict that an additional 3100 planets will be found in full-frame image data orbiting bright dwarf stars and more than 10,000 around fainter stars. We predict that TESS will find 500 planets orbiting M dwarfs, but the majority of planets will orbit stars larger than the Sun. Our simulated sample of planets contains hundreds of small planets amenable to radial velocity follow-up, potentially more than tripling the number of planets smaller than 4 R ⊕ with mass measurements. This sample of simulated planets is available for use in planning follow-up observations and analyses.},

TESS has been selected by NASA for launch in 2017 as an Astrophysics Explorer mission. The spacecraft will be placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the Earth. During its 2-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical charge-coupled device cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with IC≈4−13 for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval ranging from 1 month to 1 year, depending mainly on the star’s ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10 to 100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every 4 months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets. The TESS legacy will be a catalog of the nearest and brightest stars hosting transiting planets, which will endure as highly favorable targets for detailed investigations.},

We identified 156 planet candidates, including one object that was not previously identified as a Kepler Object of Interest. We inspected all publicly available follow-up images, observing notes, and centroid analyses, and corrected for the likelihood of false positives. We evaluated the sensitivity of our detection pipeline on a star-by-star basis by injecting 2000 transit signals into the light curve of each target star. For periods shorter than 50 days, we find Earth-size planets (1−1.5 R⊕) and super-Earths (1.5−2 R⊕) per M dwarf. In total, we estimate a cumulative planet occurrence rate of 2.5 ± 0.2 planets per M dwarf with radii 1−4 R⊕ and periods shorter than 200 days. Within a conservatively defined habitable zone (HZ) based on the moist greenhouse inner limit and maximum greenhouse outer limit, we estimate an occurrence rate of Earth-size planets and super-Earths per M dwarf HZ. Adopting the broader insolation boundaries of the recent Venus and early Mars limits yields a higher estimate of Earth-size planets and super-Earths per M dwarf HZ. This suggests that the nearest potentially habitable non-transiting and transiting Earth-size planets are 2.6 ± 0.4 pc and pc away, respectively. If we include super-Earths, these distances diminish to 2.1 ± 0.2 pc and pc.},

Similarly, studying the early evolutionary stages of low-mass stars and their planets is key for understanding how worlds both like and unlike our Solar System are born, and comes as a logical twin to the exploration of nearby planetary systems. Magnetic fields play a major role in these phases, but only fragmentary information is currently available on the fields of newborn stars and their surrounding discs, and on their impact on star / planet formation. To achieve a breakthrough on these two forefront science goals, we propose to conduct a dedicated CFHT Large Programme with SPIRou called the SPIRou Legacy Survey, for a total of 400 CFHT nights over 8 consecutive semesters (2018b-2022a).},

	abstract = {We report on the physical and chemical aeronomy of the hot Jupiter HD 209458b, a prominent case in the growing sample of known extrasolar planets. Our work is motivated by the recent detections of hydrogen, carbon and oxygen atoms obscuring about one tenth of the disk of the host star at the detection wavelengths and which have been interpreted as evidence for an escaping atmosphere. We model the escape and composition of the irradiated atmosphere by solving the equations of mass, momentum and energy conservation. At an orbital distance a∼0.05AU, intense Extreme Ultraviolet stellar irradiation may lead to the massive escape of its atmosphere. It is shown that for a planet of the characteristics of HD 209458b at small enough orbital distances, tidal forces may enhance the escape rate over the 1/a2 law inferred from simple energetic arguments, shortening the lifetime of the planet to a few Gigayears. This conclusion is contingent upon the premise of supersonic escape, on which we have based our calculations. It is expected that the atmosphere of HD 209458b contains hydrogen, helium and trace amounts of heavier elements such as carbon, oxygen and nitrogen. Indeed, the observations indicate that some of the heavier species reach as far above the surface of the planet as the lighter hydrogen atoms. We evaluate the abundances of the likely species forming from these elements and from the deuterium isotope throughout the upper atmosphere. Beyond a few planetary radii, all elements are strongly ionized, the atoms of carbon, helium and nitrogen being the first to do so. Our model, in the scenario of solar abundance for heavy constituents appears to be consistent with the observation depths of the three detected atoms. We have implemented a mass-consistent treatment of molecular and ambipolar diffusion suitable for multi-temperature multi-component gases that can be readily implemented in the modelling of planetary atmospheres.},

Theoretical estimates for the rate of energy-limited hydrogen escape from giant-planet atmospheres differ by two orders of magnitude, when one holds planetary mass, composition, and irradiation constant. Baraffe et al. [Baraffe, I., Selsis, F., Chabrier, G., Barman, T.S., Allard, F., Hauschildt, P.H., Lammer, H., 2004. Astron. Astrophys. 419, L13–L16] predict the highest rate, based on the theory of Lammer et al. [Lammer, H., Selsis, F., Ribas, I., Guinan, E.F., Bauer, S.J., Weiss, W.W., 2003. Astrophys. J. 598, L121–L124]. Scaling the theory of Watson et al. [Watson, A.J., Donahue, T.M., Walker, J.C.G., 1981. Icarus 48, 150–166] to parameters for a highly-irradiated exoplanet, we find an escape rate ∼102 lower than Baraffe's. With the scaled Watson theory we find modest mass loss, occurring early in the history of a hot EGP. In this theory, mass loss including the effect of Roche-lobe overflow becomes significant primarily for masses below a Saturn mass, for semimajor axes ⩾0.023 AU. This contrasts with the Baraffe model, where hot EGPs are claimed to be remnants of much more massive bodies, originally several times Jupiter and still losing substantial mass fractions at present.},

For planets with initial masses below {\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}crit{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, evaporation leads to a rapid expansion of the outer layers and of the total planetary radius, speeding up the evaporation process. Consequently, the planet does not survive as long as estimated by a simple application of mass loss rates without following consistently its evolution. We find out that the transit planet HD 209458b might be in such a dramatic phase, although with an extremely small probability. As a consequence, we predict that, after a certain time, only planets above a value should be present at an orbital distance {\textless}i{\textgreater}a{\textless}i/{\textgreater} of a star. For planets with initial masses above {\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}crit{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, evaporation does not affect the evolution of the radius with time.},

Based on these new measurements, we perform a joint orbit fit to the available relative astrometry from ground-based imaging, the Hipparcos Intermediate Astrometric Data (IAD), and the Gaia DR2 position, and demonstrate how to incorporate the IAD into direct imaging orbit fits. We find a mass consistent with predictions of hot-start evolutionary models and previous works following similar methods, though with larger uncertainties: 12.8+5.3 −3.2 M Jup. Our eccentricity determination of disfavors circular orbits. We consider orbit fits to several different imaging data sets, and find generally similar posteriors on the mass for each combination of imaging data. Our analysis underscores the importance of performing joint fits to the absolute and relative astrometry simultaneously, given the strong covariance between orbital elements. Time of conjunction is well-constrained within 2.8 days of 2017 September 13, with the star behind the planet’s Hill sphere between 2017 April 11 and 2018 February 16 (±18 days). Following the recent radial velocity detection of a second planet in the system, β Pic c, we perform additional two-planet fits combining relative astrometry, absolute astrometry, and stellar radial velocities. These joint fits find a significantly smaller mass (8.0 ± 2.6 M Jup) for the imaged planet β Pic b, in a somewhat more circular orbit. We expect future ground-based observations to further constrain the visual orbit and mass of the planet in advance of the release of Gaia DR4.},

	abstract = {Photoionization heating from ultraviolet (UV) radiation incidents on the atmospheres of hot Jupiters may drive planetary mass loss. Observations of stellar Lyman-α (Lyα) absorption have suggested that the hot Jupiter HD 209458b is losing atomic hydrogen. We construct a model of escape that includes realistic heating and cooling, ionization balance, tidal gravity, and pressure confinement by the host star wind. We show that mass loss takes the form of a hydrodynamic (Parker) wind, emitted from the planet's dayside during lulls in the stellar wind. When dayside winds are suppressed by the confining action of the stellar wind, nightside winds might pick up if there is sufficient horizontal transport of heat. A hot Jupiter loses mass at maximum rates of ∼2 × 1012 g s–1 during its host star's pre-main-sequence phase and ∼2 × 1010 g s–1 during the star's main-sequence lifetime, for total maximum losses of ∼0.06\% and ∼0.6\% of the planet's mass, respectively. For UV fluxes F UV ≲ 104 erg cm–2 s–1, the mass-loss rate is approximately energy limited and scales as . For larger UV fluxes, such as those typical of T Tauri stars, radiative losses and plasma recombination force to increase more slowly as F 0.6 UV. Dayside winds are quenched during the T Tauri phase because of confinement by overwhelming stellar wind pressure. During this early stage, nightside winds can still blow if the planet resides outside the stellar Alfvén radius; otherwise, even nightside winds are stifled by stellar magnetic pressure, and mass loss is restricted to polar regions. We conclude that while UV radiation can indeed drive winds from hot Jupiters, such winds cannot significantly alter planetary masses during any evolutionary stage. They can, however, produce observable signatures. Candidates for explaining why the Lyman-α photons of HD 209458 are absorbed at Doppler-shifted velocities of ±100 km s–1 include charge-exchange in the shock between the planetary and stellar winds.},

This paper extends DE-MC with a snooker updater and shows by simulation and real examples that DEMC can work for d up to 50–100 with fewer parallel chains (e.g. N = 3) by exploiting information from their past by generating jumps from differences of pairs of past states. This approach extends the practical applicability of DE-MC and is shown to be about 5–26 times more efﬁcient than the optimal Normal random walk Metropolis sampler for the 97.5\% point of a variable from a 25–50 dimensional Student t3 distribution. In a nonlinear mixed effects model example the approach outperformed a block-updater geared to the speciﬁc features of the model.},

	abstract = {In the 20+ years of Doppler observations of stars, scientists have uncovered a diverse population of extrasolar multi-planet systems. A common technique for characterizing the orbital elements of these planets is the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), using a Keplerian model with random walk proposals and paired with the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. For approximately a couple of dozen planetary systems with Doppler observations, there are strong planet–planet interactions due to the system being in or near a mean-motion resonance (MMR). An N-body model is often required to accurately describe these systems. Further computational difﬁculties arise from exploring a high-dimensional parameter space (∼7 × number of planets) that can have complex parameter correlations, particularly for systems near a MMR. To surmount these challenges, we introduce a differential evolution MCMC (DEMCMC) algorithm applied to radial velocity data while incorporating self-consistent N-body integrations. Our Radial velocity Using N-body DEMCMC (RUN DMC) algorithm improves upon the random walk proposal distribution of the traditional MCMC by using an ensemble of Markov chains to adaptively improve the proposal distribution. RUN DMC can sample more efﬁciently from high-dimensional parameter spaces that have strong correlations between model parameters. We describe the methodology behind the algorithm, along with results of tests for accuracy and performance. We ﬁnd that most algorithm parameters have a modest effect on the rate of convergence. However, the size of the ensemble can have a strong effect on performance. We show that the optimal choice depends on the number of planets in a system, as well as the computer architecture used and the resulting extent of parallelization. While the exact choices of optimal algorithm parameters will inevitably vary due to the details of individual planetary systems (e.g., number of planets, number of observations, orbital periods, and signal-to-noise of each planet), we offer recommendations for choosing the DEMCMC algorithm’s algorithmic parameters that result in excellent performance for a wide variety of planetary systems.},

	abstract = {Differential Evolution (DE) is a simple genetic algorithm for numerical optimization in real parameter spaces. In a statistical context one would not just want the optimum but also its uncertainty. The uncertainty distribution can be obtained by a Bayesian analysis (after specifying prior and likelihood) using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. This paper integrates the essential ideas of DE and MCMC, resulting in Differential Evolution Markov Chain (DE-MC). DE-MC is a population MCMC algorithm, in which multiple chains are run in parallel. DE-MC solves an important problem in MCMC, namely that of choosing an appropriate scale and orientation for the jumping distribution. In DE-MC the jumps are simply a ﬁxed multiple of the differences of two random parameter vectors that are currently in the population. The selection process of DE-MC works via the usual Metropolis ratio which deﬁnes the probability with which a proposal is accepted. In tests with known uncertainty distributions, the efﬁciency of DE-MC with respect to random walk Metropolis with optimal multivariate Normal jumps ranged from 68\% for small population sizes to 100\% for large population sizes and even to 500\% for the 97.5\% point of a variable from a 50-dimensional Student distribution. Two Bayesian examples illustrate the potential of DE-MC in practice. DE-MC is shown to facilitate multidimensional updates in a multi-chain “Metropolis-withinGibbs” sampling approach. The advantage of DE-MC over conventional MCMC are simplicity, speed of calculation and convergence, even for nearly collinear parameters and multimodal densities.},

The planet signal is distilled from the bright starlight, combining ral and time-differential filtering techniques. In parallel, high-contrast imaging (HCI) is developing rapidly, aimed at spatially separating the planet from the star. While HDS is limited by the overwhelming noise from the host star, HCI is limited by residual quasi-static speckles. Both techniques currently reach planet-star contrast limits down to {\textasciitilde}10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-5{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}, albeit for very different types of planetary systems.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}In this work, we discuss a way to combine HDS and HCI (HDS+HCI). For a planet located at a resolvable angular distance from its host star, the starlight can be reduced up to several orders of magnitude using adaptive optics and/or coronography. In addition, the remaining starlight can be filtered out using high-dispersion spectroscopy, utilizing the significantly different (or Doppler shifted) high-dispersion spectra of the planet and star. In this way, HDS+HCI can {\textless}i{\textgreater}in principle {\textless}i/{\textgreater}reach contrast limits of {\textasciitilde}10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-5{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} × 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-5{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}, although in practice this will be limited by photon noise and/or sky-background. In contrast to current direct imaging techniques, such as Angular Differential Imaging and Spectral Differential Imaging, it will work well at small working angles and is much less sensitive to speckle noise. For the discovery of previously unknown planets HDS+HCI requires a high-contrast adaptive optics system combined with a high-dispersion {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 100 000 integral field spectrograph (IFS). This combination currently does not exist, but is planned for the European Extremely Large Telescope.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We present simulations of HDS+HCI observations with the E-ELT, both probing thermal emission from a planet at infrared wavelengths, and starlight reflected off a planet atmosphere at optical wavelengths. For the infrared simulations we use the baseline parameters of the E-ELT and METIS instrument, with the latter combining extreme adaptive optics with an {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 100 000 IFS. We include realistic models of the adaptive optics performance and atmospheric transmission and emission. For the optical simulation we also assume {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 100 000 IFS with adaptive optics capabilities at the E-ELT.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}One night of HDS+HCI observations with the E-ELT at 4.8 {\textless}i{\textgreater}μ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}m (Δ{\textless}i{\textgreater}λ{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 0.07 {\textless}i{\textgreater}μ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}m) can detect a planet orbiting {\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Cen A with a radius of {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 1.5 {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}earth{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and a twin-Earth thermal spectrum of {\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}eq{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 300 K at a signal-to-noise (S/N) of 5. In the optical, with a Strehl ratio performance of 0.3, reflected light from an Earth-size planet in the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri can be detected at a S/N of 10 in the same time frame.

	doi = {10.1117/12.2056453},
	abstract = {This paper gives an overview of the CARMENES instrument and of the survey that will be carried out with it during the first years of operation. CARMENES (Calar Alto high-Resolution search for M dwarfs with Exoearths with Near-infrared and optical Echelle Spectrographs) is a next-generation radial-velocity instrument under construction for the 3.5m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory by a consortium of eleven Spanish and German institutions. The scientific goal of the project is conducting a 600-night exoplanet survey targeting {\textasciitilde} 300 M dwarfs with the completed instrument. The CARMENES instrument consists of two separate echelle spectrographs covering the wavelength range from 0.55 to 1.7 \&mu;m at a spectral resolution of R = 82,000, fed by fibers from the Cassegrain focus of the telescope. The spectrographs are housed in vacuum tanks providing the temperature-stabilized environments necessary to enable a 1 m/s radial velocity precision employing a simultaneous calibration with an emission-line lamp or with a Fabry-Perot etalon. For mid-M to late-M spectral types, the wavelength range around 1.0 \&mu;m (Y band) is the most important wavelength region for radial velocity work. Therefore, the efficiency of CARMENES has been optimized in this range. The CARMENES instrument consists of two spectrographs, one equipped with a 4k x 4k pixel CCD for the range 0.55 - 1.05 \&mu;m, and one with two 2k x 2k pixel HgCdTe detectors for the range from 0.95 - 1.7\&mu;m. Each spectrograph will be coupled to the 3.5m telescope with two optical fibers, one for the target, and one for calibration light. The front end contains a dichroic beam splitter and an atmospheric dispersion corrector, to feed the light into the fibers leading to the spectrographs. Guiding is performed with a separate camera; on-axis as well as off-axis guiding modes are implemented. Fibers with octagonal cross-section are employed to ensure good stability of the output in the presence of residual guiding errors. The fibers are continually actuated to reduce modal noise. The spectrographs are mounted on benches inside vacuum tanks located in the coud´e laboratory of the 3.5m dome. Each vacuum tank is equipped with a temperature stabilization system capable of keeping the temperature constant to within \&plusmn;0.01\&deg;C over 24 hours. The visible-light spectrograph will be operated near room temperature, while the near-IR spectrograph will be cooled to {\textasciitilde} 140 K. The CARMENES instrument passed its final design review in February 2013. The MAIV phase is currently ongoing. First tests at the telescope are scheduled for early 2015. Completion of the full instrument is planned for the fall of 2015. At least 600 useable nights have been allocated at the Calar Alto 3.5m Telescope for the CARMENES survey in the time frame until 2018. A data base of M stars (dubbed CARMENCITA) has been compiled from which the CARMENES sample can be selected. CARMENCITA contains information on all relevant properties of the potential targets. Dedicated imaging, photometric, and spectroscopic observations are underway to provide crucial data on these stars that are not available in the literature.},

	abstract = {Since 1st light in 2002, HARPS has been setting the standard in the exo-planet detection by radial velocity (RV) measurements[1]. Based on this experience, our consortium is developing a high accuracy near-infrared RV spectrograph covering YJH bands to detect and characterize low-mass planets in the habitable zone of M dwarfs. It will allow RV measurements at the 1-m/s level and will look for habitable planets around M- type stars by following up the candidates found by the upcoming space missions TESS, CHEOPS and later PLATO. NIRPS and HARPS, working simultaneously on the ESO 3.6m are bound to become a single powerful high-resolution, high-fidelity spectrograph covering from 0.4 to 1.8 micron. NIRPS will complement HARPS in validating earth-like planets found around G and K-type stars whose signal is at the same order of magnitude than the stellar noise. Because at equal resolving power the overall dimensions of a spectrograph vary linearly with the input beam étendue, spectrograph designed for seeing-limited observations are large and expensive. NIRPS will use a high order adaptive optics system to couple the starlight into a fiber corresponding to 0.4” on the sky as efficiently or better than HARPS or ESPRESSO couple the light 0.9” fiber. This allows the spectrograph to be very compact, more thermally stable and less costly. Using a custom tan(θ)=4 dispersion grating in combination with a start-of-the-art Hawaii4RG detector makes NIRPS very efficient with complete coverage of the YJH bands at 110’000 resolution. NIRPS works in a regime that is in-between the usual multi-mode (MM) where 1000’s of modes propagates in the fiber and the single mode well suited for perfect optical systems. This regime called few-modes regime is prone to modal noise- Results from a significant R and D effort made to characterize and circumvent the modal noise show that this contribution to the performance budget shall not preclude the RV performance to be achieved.},

	abstract = {Identifying terrestrial planets in the habitable zones (HZs) of other stars is one of the primary goals of ongoing radial velocity (RV) and transit exoplanet surveys and proposed future space missions. Most current estimates of the boundaries of the HZ are based on one-dimensional (1D), cloud-free, climate model calculations by Kasting et al. However, this model used band models that were based on older HITRAN and HITEMP line-by-line databases. The inner edge of the HZ in the Kasting et al. model was determined by loss of water, and the outer edge was determined by the maximum greenhouse provided by a CO2 atmosphere. A conservative estimate for the width of the HZ from this model in our solar system is 0.95-1.67 AU. Here an updated 1D radiative-convective, cloud-free climate model is used to obtain new estimates for HZ widths around F, G, K, and M stars. New H2O and CO2 absorption coefficients, derived from the HITRAN 2008 and HITEMP 2010 line-by-line databases, are important improvements to the climate model. According to the new model, the water-loss (inner HZ) and maximum greenhouse (outer HZ) limits for our solar system are at 0.99 and 1.70 AU, respectively, suggesting that the present Earth lies near the inner edge. Additional calculations are performed for stars with effective temperatures between 2600 and 7200 K, and the results are presented in parametric form, making them easy to apply to actual stars. The new model indicates that, near the inner edge of the HZ, there is no clear distinction between runaway greenhouse and water-loss limits for stars with T eff ≲ 5000 K, which has implications for ongoing planet searches around K and M stars. To assess the potential habitability of extrasolar terrestrial planets, we propose using stellar flux incident on a planet rather than equilibrium temperature. This removes the dependence on planetary (Bond) albedo, which varies depending on the host star's spectral type. We suggest that conservative estimates of the HZ (water-loss and maximum greenhouse limits) should be used for current RV surveys and Kepler mission to obtain a lower limit on η⊕, so that future flagship missions like TPF-C and Darwin are not undersized. Our model does not include the radiative effects of clouds; thus, the actual HZ boundaries may extend further in both directions than the estimates just given.},

One of the instrument’s primary science goals is to discover the closest exoplanets to the solar system by conducting a three- to five-year long radial velocity survey of nearby M dwarfs at an expected precision of ∼1 m s−1, the SPIRou Legacy Survey-Planet Search (SLS-PS). In this study, we conduct a detailed Monte Carlo simulation of the SLS-PS using our current understanding of the occurrence rate of M dwarf planetary systems and physical models of stellar activity. From simultaneous modeling of planetary signals and activity, we predict the population of planets to be detected in the SLS-PS. With our fiducial survey strategy and expected instrument performance over a nominal survey length of ∼3 years, we expect SPIRou to detect planets including habitable-zone planets and Earth-like planets from a sample of 100 M1–M8.5 dwarfs out to 11 pc. By studying mid-to-late M dwarfs previously inaccessible to existing optical velocimeters, SPIRou will put meaningful constraints on the occurrence rate of planets around those stars including the value of at an expected level of precision of . We also predict that a subset of planets may be accessible with dedicated high-contrast imagers on the next generation of extremely large telescopes including potentially imagable Earth-like planets. Lastly, we compare the results of our fiducial survey strategy to other foreseeable survey versions to quantify which strategy is optimized to reach the SLS-PS science goals. The results of our simulations are made available to the community on GitHub (https://github.com/r-cloutier/SLSPS\_Simulations).},

Carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere during burial of weathered minerals and returned to the atmosphere through volcanism. On million-year time scales, the carbonate-silicate cycle is a key factor in controlling Earth's climate because it regulates carbon dioxide levels and therefore global temperature.However the rate of weathering is sensitive to factors that modulate how much land is exposed. These factors include sea level, topography, lithology, and vegetation changes. Furthermore, these geomorphic and chemical changes have worked in tandem with solar forcing, whether due to orbital changes or stellar evolution, to determine the global surface temperature. Additionally, the carbonate-silicate cycle has been considered a possible solution to the Faint young Sun paradox.},

	abstract = {A one-dimensional climate model is used to estimate the width of the habitable zone (HZ) around our Sun and around other main sequence stars. Our basic premise is that we are dealing with Earth-like planets with CO2/H2O/N2 atmospheres and that habitability requires the presence of liquid water on the planet's surface. The inner edge of the HZ is determined in our model by loss of water via photolysis and hydrogen escape. The outer edge of the HZ is determined by the formation of CO2 clouds, which cool a planet's surface by increasing its albedo and by lowering the convective lapse rate. Conservative estimates for these distances in our own Solar System are 0.95 and 1.37 AU, respectively; the actual width of the present HZ could be much greater. Between these two limits, climate stability is ensured by a feedback mechanism in which atmospheric CO2 concentrations vary inversely with planetary surface temperature. The width of the HZ is slightly greater for planets that are larger than Earth and for planets which have higher N2 partial pressures. The HZ evolves outward in time because the Sun increases in luminosity as it ages. A conservative estimate for the width of the 4.6-Gyr continuously habitable zone (CHZ) is 0.95 to 1.15 AU. Stars later than F0 have main sequence lifetimes exceeding 2 Gyr and, so, are also potential candidates for harboring habitable planets. The HZ around an F star is larger and occurs farther out than for our Sun; the HZ around K and M stars is smaller and occurs farther in. Nevertheless, the widths of all of these HZs are approximately the same if distance is expressed on a logarithmic scale. A log distance scale is probably the appropriate scale for this problem because the planets in our own Solar System are spaced logarithmically and because the distance at which another star would be expected to form planets should be related to the star's mass. The width of the CHZ around other stars depends on the time that a planet is required to remain habitable and on whether a planet that is initially frozen can be thawed by modest increases in stellar luminosity. For a specified period of habitability, CHZs around K and M stars are wider (in log distance) than for our Sun because these stars evolve more slowly. Planets orbiting late K stars and M stars may not be habitable, however, because they can become trapped in synchronous rotation as a consequence of tidal damping. F stars have narrower (log distance) CHZ's than our Sun because they evolve more rapidly. Our results suggest that mid-to-early K stars should be considered along with G stars as optimal candidates in the search for extraterrestrial life.},

	abstract = {It is likely that unambiguous habitable zone terrestrial planets of unknown water content will soon be discovered. Water content helps determine surface land fraction, which influences planetary weathering behavior. This is important because the silicate-weathering feedback determines the width of the habitable zone in space and time. Here a low-order model of weathering and climate, useful for gaining qualitative understanding, is developed to examine climate evolution for planets of various land-ocean fractions. It is pointed out that, if seafloor weathering does not depend directly on surface temperature, there can be no weathering-climate feedback on a waterworld. This would dramatically narrow the habitable zone of a waterworld. Results from our model indicate that weathering behavior does not depend strongly on land fraction for partially ocean-covered planets. This is powerful because it suggests that previous habitable zone theory is robust to changes in land fraction, as long as there is some land. Finally, a mechanism is proposed for a waterworld to prevent complete water loss during a moist greenhouse through rapid weathering of exposed continents. This process is named a “waterworld self-arrest,” and it implies that waterworlds can go through a moist greenhouse stage and end up as planets like Earth with partial ocean coverage. This work stresses the importance of surface and geologic effects, in addition to the usual incident stellar flux, for habitability.},

	abstract = {In this chapter, we will deal with the discovery of the first extrasolar planets around normal stars. This discovery took place in the mid-1990s thanks to the analysis of periodic Doppler shifts in stellar spectra and turned out to be a landmark achievement, in that it established a new field of research that is growing at full speed since then, and at the same time, it answered a question – do other worlds exist in the cosmos? – that dates back to ancient times. This major result was made possible by the impressive improvement in Doppler analysis techniques during the second half of the twentieth century, until the precision boosted to values suitable to detect massive planets in close-in orbits. In the late 1980s, two objects came to the limelight: HD 114762 b and γ Cep b. They were suspected to be exoplanets, but it was not possible to rule out alternative explanations, so no undisputable discovery could be claimed. A few years later, in 1995, the discovery of 51 Peg b was announced and confirmed as the first secure one. However, the features of this planet were quite weird as compared to those of the planets of the Solar System, as it was massive and very close to its parent star. Its discovery overturned the previously widespread idea that other systems had to be made like ours and opened the floodgates to the spotting of many other planets. In this chapter, we will tell this story, mainly dwelling upon the historical and epistemological aspects.},

	abstract = {The 2001 discovery of radio emission from ultracool dwarfs (UCDs), the very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs with spectral types of ∼M7 and later, revealed that these objects can generate and dissipate powerful magnetic fields. Radio observations provide unparalleled insight into UCD magnetism: detections extend to brown dwarfs with temperatures {\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}lesssim {\textbackslash})1000 K, where no other observational probes are effective. The data reveal that UCDs can generate strong (kG) fields, sometimes with a stable dipolar structure; that they can produce and retain nonthermal plasmas with electron acceleration extending to MeV energies; and that they can drive auroral current systems resulting in significant atmospheric energy deposition and powerful, coherent radio bursts. Still to be understood are the underlying dynamo processes, the precise means by which particles are accelerated around these objects, the observed diversity of magnetic phenomenologies, and how all of these factors change as the mass of the central object approaches that of Jupiter. The answers to these questions are doubly important because UCDs are both potential exoplanet hosts, as in the TRAPPIST-1 system, and analogues of extrasolar giant planets themselves.},

The specific roles of waves, radiation, as well as convection in shaping temperature profiles are then discussed. In a second part, the particulate components of these atmospheres, clouds and aerosols, are described in terms of their physical properties (composition, optical properties) and of their variability in both space and time. Mars, Venus, and Titan exhibit a remarkable variety of clouds and aerosols. Our knowledge about them has made considerable progress thanks to the success of space missions during the last two decades, while in parallel theoretical models have improved to the point that three-dimensional Global Climate Models now include the detailed physics of clouds and aerosols. As a result, it is now widely recognized that particulates play a key role in forcing the climate and the evolution of these bodies.},

	abstract = {Early thinking about detecting extrasolar planets was largely circumscribed by the expectation that other solar systems would be similar to our own, the only known example at the time. Given this mind-set, transit detections were expected to be exceedingly difficult for small planets and rarely seen for larger ones. The discovery of 51 Peg and subsequent hot Jupiters by the radial velocity method completely upended our thinking – transits were suddenly practical, perhaps even easy! This immediately led to follow-up searches for transits in systems discovered by the radial velocity technique and, conversely, to wide-field ground-based transit search programs with radial velocity follow-up observations. As is usually the case, transit work turned out to be harder than initially expected but was still possible and productive. This chapter reviews the circumstances leading to the first transit observations of HD 209458, the early OGLE exoplanets, and TrES-1 and TrES-2, as well as some of the frustrations and difficulties encountered along the way.},

The lithium test has proven to be a very useful tool to distinguish between brown dwarfs and stars and to determine the ages of young open clusters. Young substellar objects show spectral features that are sensitive to surface gravity, which is expected to be lower than in older field counterparts of similar effective temperature. The studies of the substellar mass function indicate that brown dwarfs are very numerous, about one-third of the total number of stars, but their contribution in mass is lower than 10\%. The formation of substellar objects extends below the deuterium-burning mass limit, which is the realm of the so-called free-floating or isolated planetary-mass objects that overlap with the masses of exoplanets.},

Currently about 3\% of all refereed articles in astronomy are focused on exoplanets, whereas about a quarter of the science cases for very large multipurpose astronomical instruments is based on exoplanet science. Interactions with the public occur on several levels; we present an overview of exoplanet-related citizen science and discuss the influence of the public’s exposure to media coverage about exoplanets and life in the universe. This influence is changing the public’s perception about the uniqueness of our Earth and about the presence of extraterrestrial life. In turn, this perception affects the public support for the research infrastructure that is necessary to maintain the growth of the field of exoplanetology.

The method has however also drawbacks, which are the low probability that transits appear in randomly oriented planet systems and the presence of astrophysical phenomena that may mimic transits and give rise to false detection positives. In the second part, we outline the main factors that determine the design of transit surveys, such as the size of the survey sample, the temporal coverage, the detection precision, the sample brightness and the methods to extract transit events from observed light curves. Lastly, an overview over past, current, and future transit surveys is given. For these surveys we indicate their basic instrument configuration and their planet catch, including the ranges of planet sizes and stellar magnitudes that were encountered.

The method has its roots in binary star astronomy, and exoplanet detection represents the low-companion-mass limit of that application. This limit requires control of several effects of much greater magnitude than the signal sought: the motion of the telescope must be subtracted, the instrument must be calibrated, and spurious Doppler shift “jitter” must be mitigated or corrected. Two primary forms of instrumental calibration are the stable spectrograph and absorption cell methods, the former being the path taken for the next generation of spectrographs. Spurious, apparent Doppler shifts due to non-center-of-mass motion (jitter) can be the result of stellar magnetic activity or photospheric motions and granulation. Several avoidance, mitigation, and correction strategies exist, including careful analysis of line shapes and radial velocity wavelength dependence.},

Provided that starlight can be canceled with a coronagraph to reduce contamination, the measurements can be of high quality and take full advantage of the sensitivity offered by current and future large ground-based telescopes.Adaptive optics and starlight suppression techniques are essential to deliver the high-contrast imaging performance required for exoplanet imaging. While a few young warm giant planets have been imaged from the ground, the vast majority of exoplanets, including habitable planets, remains beyond current AO systems capabilities. Yet, thanks to rapid ongoing developments in adaptive optics and coronagraphy, and the upcoming generation of 30-m class giant segmented mirror telescopes (GSMTs), direct imaging is poised to reveal and characterize a large number of planets, including nearby habitable planets.},

As the solar system is teeming with moons, more than a hundred of which are in orbit around the eight local planets, and with all of the local giant planets showing complex ring systems, astronomers have naturally started to search for moons and rings around exoplanets in the past few years. We here discuss the principles of the observational methods that have been proposed to find moons and rings beyond the solar system, and we review the first searches.

Subsequent spacecraft investigations have revealed that many of the planets, and even some moons, either have or have had a planetary-scale magnetic field. In the case of the Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, the magnetic field is generated by dynamo processes within the planet, and an interaction between the solar wind and their magnetic fields generates intense radio emission via the electron cyclotron maser instability. Not only may the radio emissions be a means for discovering extrasolar planets, because magnetic fields are tied to the properties of planetary interiors, radio emissions may be a remote sensing means of constraining extrasolar planetary properties that will be otherwise difficult to access. In the case of terrestrial planets, the presence or absence of a magnetic field may be an indicator for habitability. While no extrasolar planets have yet been detected in the radio, new ground-based telescopes and new possibilities for space-based telescopes provide promise for the near future.},

Since the last review, the Kepler spacecraft has detected several hundred perturbed planets. In a few cases, these data have been used to discover additional planets, similar to the historical discovery of Neptune in our own solar system. However, the more impactful aspect of TTV and TDV studies has been characterization of planetary systems in which multiple planets transit. After addressing the equations of motion and parameter scalings, the main dynamical mechanisms for TTV and TDV are described, with citations to the observational literature for real examples. We describe parameter constraints, particularly the origin of the mass/eccentricity degeneracy and how it is overcome by the high-frequency component of the signal. On the observational side, derivation of timing precision and introduction to the timing diagram are given. Science results are reviewed, with an emphasis on mass measurements of transiting sub-Neptunes and super-Earths, from which bulk compositions may be inferred.},

This chapter first provides a presentation of the microlensing theory, including numerical aspects to solve binary and triple lens problems, and a discussion of the microlensing planetary detection efficiency, with a high potential regarding cold planets beyond the snow line. It also explains how the planetary characterization can be facilitated when the microlensing light curves exhibit distortions due to second-order effects, such as parallax, planetary orbital motion, and extended source, and how they can also introduce degeneracies in the models. The chapter then reviews the main discoveries to date and the recent statistical results from high-cadence ground-based surveys and space-based observations, especially on the planet mass function and the distance distribution of the microlensing planetary systems. Finally, future prospects are discussed, with the expected advances from dedicated space missions, extending the planet sensitivity range down to Mercury masses.},

Several techniques have been investigated using different types of instrument with limited impact on exoplanet detection so far, but the technique has not only great potentials but is complementary to other discovery methods. The importance of stability and precision of the astrometric measurements over a long period may explain the relative lack of results, but the advent of a space mission like Gaia will certainly change the impact of astrometry in the exoplanet field.},

These instruments were extremely successful (e.g., with the discovery of 51 Peg b), it however quickly became clear that higher precision would be necessary in order not to remain stuck with Jupiter- and Saturn-mass planets only. The ELODIE/CORALIE concept was optimized in order to reach best possible performances. This process led to the development of HARPS that has become, through the tens of discoveries of Super-Earths and Neptunes, the new reference for high-precision Doppler velocity measurements. The success of HARPS had to be transposed to the northern hemisphere, an ambition that resulted first in the manufacturing of SOPHIE and later of HARPS-N. This work was finally the baseline for the development of ESPRESSO aiming at the next level of precision. We refer, however, to the chapter dedicated to ESPRESSO in this same handbook for a detailed description.},

However, it is applicable to any pulsating star with sufficiently stable oscillations. Care must be taken to ensure that the changes in pulsation arrival times are not caused by intrinsic stellar variability; an external, light-travel-time effect from an exoplanet identically affects all pulsation modes. With more long-baseline photometric campaigns coming online, this method is yielding new detections of substellar companions.},

	abstract = {The solar system presents us with a number of planetary bodies with shallow atmospheres that are sufficiently Earth-like in their form and structure to be termed “terrestrial.” These atmospheres have much in common, in having circulations that are driven primarily by heating from the Sun and radiative cooling to space, which vary markedly with latitude. The principal response to this forcing is typically in the form of a (roughly zonally symmetric) meridional overturning that transports heat vertically upward and in latitude. But even within the solar system, these planets exhibit many differences in the types of large-scale waves and instabilities that also contribute substantially to determining their respective climates. Here we argue that the study of simplified models (either numerical simulations or laboratory experiments) provides considerable insights into the likely roles of planetary size, rotation, thermal stratification, and other factors in determining the styles of global circulation and dominant waves and instability processes. We discuss the importance of a number of key dimensionless parameters, for example, the thermal Rossby and the Burger numbers as well as nondimensional measures of the frictional or radiative timescales, in defining the type of circulation regime to be expected in a prototypical planetary atmosphere subject to axisymmetric driving. These considerations help to place each of the solar system terrestrial planets into an appropriate dynamical context and also lay the foundations for predicting and understanding the climate and circulation regimes of (as yet undiscovered) Earth-like extrasolar planets. However, as recent discoveries of “super-Earth” planets around some nearby stars are beginning to reveal, this parameter space is likely to be incomplete, and other factors, such as the possibility of tidally locked rotation and tidal forcing, may also need to be taken into account for some classes of extrasolar planet.},

	abstract = {The upper atmospheres of the planets and their satellites are more directly exposed to sunlight and solar-wind particles than the surface or the deeper atmospheric layers. At the altitudes where the associated energy is deposited, the atmospheres may become ionized and are referred to as ionospheres. The details of the photon and particle interactions with the upper atmosphere depend strongly on whether the object has an intrinsic magnetic field that may channel the precipitating particles into the atmosphere or drive the atmospheric gas out to space. Important implications of these interactions include atmospheric loss over diverse timescales, photochemistry, and the formation of aerosols, which affect the evolution, composition, and remote sensing of the planets (satellites). The upper atmosphere connects the planet (satellite) bulk composition to the near-planet (-satellite) environment. Understanding the relevant physics and chemistry provides insight to the past and future conditions of these objects, which is critical for understanding their evolution. This chapter introduces the basic concepts of upper atmospheres and ionospheres in our solar system and discusses aspects of their neutral and ion composition, wind dynamics, and energy budget. This knowledge is key to putting in context the observations of upper atmospheres and haze on exoplanets and to devise a theory that explains exoplanet demographics.},

Observations show that these two types of fluid and cold planets differ in their general circulation at cloud level. Jupiter and Saturn are dominated by a jet system that alternates in their direction with latitude, and both possess an intense eastward equatorial jet. On the other hand, Uranus and Neptune show a dominating intense and wide in latitude westward jet symmetric with respect to the equator. In spite of this difference, the four planets present similar atmospheric dynamical phenomena (large-scale vortices, storms, and long waves, among others). Deep convection models have shown that turbulent convection resulting in angular momentum mixing may explain the westward (retrograde) equatorial flow on the ice giants. The jet systems of Jupiter and Saturn have been successfully reproduced using deep convection and shallow forcing models. However, the prograde equatorial flow of the gas giants is more naturally reproduced with deep models or hybrid shallow models incorporating aspects of deeper forcing.},

A common sharing of atmospheres is that they are dominantly supported by seasonally varying sublimation/condensation exchanges with the surface. Io’s atmosphere is still fundamentally different from Pluto and Triton in that it presents large horizontal variability. Pluto’s atmosphere, and to a lesser extent Triton’s, are reduced (∼10 μbar class) and colder versions of Titan’s, including in particular a coupled nitrogen-methane chemistry that leads to the production of hydrocarbons, nitriles, and haze. Albeit similar in terms of surface pressure and temperature, Pluto’s and Triton’s atmospheres show marked differences in terms of thermal structure and detailed composition – that are amenable to differences in the ∼20 times smaller atmospheric methane mixing ratio on Triton versus Pluto – itself related to a smaller abundance in the ice phase. Io’s dominantly SO2, nanobar-class atmosphere has immediate support mostly from sublimating surface frost, with a contribution from volcanic plumes. The latter are also important in feeding the atmosphere with nonvolatile gases including SO, S2, NaCl, and KCl. The gas temperature, vertical structure, and dynamics of Io’s atmosphere remain poorly understood.},

We review the planet transits which were anticipated and searched and the first ones which were observed all through history.Indeed transits of planets in front of their star were first investigated and studied in the Solar System, concerning the star Sun. The first observations of sunspots were sometimes mistaken for transits of unknown planets. The first scientific observation and study of a transit in the Solar System was the observation of Mercury transit by Pierre Gassendi in 1631. Because observations of Venus transits could give a way to determine the distance Sun-Earth, transits of Venus were overwhelmingly observed. Some objects which actually do not exist were searched by their hypothetical transits on the Sun, as some examples a Venus satellite and an infra-mercurial planet. We evoke the possible first use of the hypothesis of an exoplanet transit to explain some periodic variations of the luminosity of a star, namely, the star Algol, during the eighteenth century.Then we review the predictions of detection of exoplanets by their transits, those predictions being sometimes ancient and made by astronomers as well as popular science writers. However, these very interesting predictions were never published in peer-reviewed journals specialized in astronomical discoveries and results.A possible transit of the planet β Pic b was observed in 1981. Shall we see another transit expected for the same planet during 2018?Nowadays, some studies of transits which are connected to hypothetical extraterrestrial civilizations are published in astronomical peer-reviewed journals. So we can note that the discovery of exoplanets is modiying in the research methods of astronomers. Some studies which would be classified not long ago as science fiction are now considered as scientific ones.},

	abstract = {The G0 V star HD 166435 has been observed by the fiber-fed spectrograph ELODIE as one of the targets in the large extra-solar planet survey that we are conducting at the Observatory of Haute-Provence. We detected coherent, low-amplitude, radial-velocity variations with a period of 3.7987 days, suggesting a possible close-in planetary companion. Subsequently, we initiated a series of high-precision photometric observations to search for possible planetary transits and an additional series of Ca II H and K observations to measure the level of surface magnetic activity and to look for possible rotational modulation. Surprisingly, we found the star to be photometrically variable and magnetically active. A detailed study of the phase stability of the radial-velocity signal revealed that the radial-velocity variability remains coherent only for durations of about 30 days. Analysis of the time variation of the spectroscopic line profiles using line bisectors revealed a correlation between radial velocity and line-bisector orientation. All of these observations, along with a one-quarter cycle phase shift between the photometric and the radial-velocity variations, are well explained by the presence of dark photospheric spots on HD 166435. We conclude that the radial-velocity variations are not due to gravitational interaction with an orbiting planet but, instead, originate from line-profile changes stemming from star spots on the surface of the star. The quasi-coherence of the radial-velocity signal over more than two years, which allowed a fair fit with a binary model, makes the stability of this star unusual among other active stars. It suggests a stable magnetic field orientation where spots are always generated at about the same location on the surface of the star.},

	abstract = {Gl 758 B is a late-T dwarf orbiting a metal-rich Sun-like star at a projected separation of ρ ≈ 1.″6 (25 au). We present four epochs of astrometry of this system with NIRC2 at Keck Observatory spanning 2010 to 2017 together with 630 radial velocities (RVs) of the host star acquired over the past two decades from McDonald Observatory, Keck Observatory, and the Automated Planet Finder at Lick Observatory. The RVs reveal that Gl 758 is accelerating with an evolving rate that varies between 2 and 5 m s−1 yr−1, consistent with the expected influence of the imaged companion Gl 758 B. A joint fit of the RVs and astrometry yields a dynamical mass of M Jup for the companion with a robust lower limit of 30.5 M Jup at the 4-σ level. Gl 758 B is on an eccentric orbit (e = 0.26–0.67 at 95\% confidence) with a semimajor axis of a = au and an orbital period of P = yr, which takes it within ≈9 au from its host star at periastron passage. Substellar evolutionary models generally underpredict the mass of Gl 758 B for nominal ages of 1–6 Gyr that have previously been adopted for the host star. This discrepancy can be reconciled if the system is older—which is consistent with activity indicators and recent isochrone fitting of the host star—or alternatively if the models are systematically overluminous by ≈0.1–0.2 dex. Gl 758 B is currently the lowest-mass directly imaged companion inducing a measured acceleration on its host star. In the future, bridging RVs and high-contrast imaging with the next generation of extremely large telescopes and space-based facilities will open the door to the first dynamical mass measurements of imaged exoplanets.},

Even when the presence of a transiting planet and hence its period are known, stellar activity can be the main barrier to measuring the correct amplitude of the radial velocity signal. Several tools are being used to help understand which signals come from stellar activity in the data.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We aim to present a new tool that can be used for the purpose of identifying periodicities caused by stellar activity, and show how it can be used to track the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the detection over time. The tool is based on the principle that stellar activity signals are variable and incoherent.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We calculate the Bayesian general Lomb-Scargle periodogram for subsets of data and by adding one extra data point we track what happens to the presence and significance of periodicities in the data. Publicly available datasets from HARPS and HARPS-N were used for this purpose. Additionally, we analysed a synthetic dataset that we created with SOAP2.0 to simulate pure stellar activity and a mixture of stellar activity and a planet.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We find that this tool can easily be used to identify unstable and incoherent signals, such as those introduced by stellar activity. The S/N of the detection grows approximately as the square root of the number of data points, in the case of a stable signal. This can then be used to make decisions on whether it is useful to keep observing a specific object. The tool is relatively fast and easy to use, and thus lends itself perfectly to a quick analysis of the data.},

	abstract = {We go through the many considerations involved in fitting a model to data, using as an example the fit of a straight line to a set of points in a two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

We developed in 2004 a method to extend such searches to earlier A-F type dwarfs and started spectroscopic surveys to search for planets and quantify the detection limit achievable when taking the stars properties (Spectral Type, {\textless}i{\textgreater}v{\textless}i/{\textgreater} sin {\textless}i{\textgreater}i{\textless}i/{\textgreater}) and their actual levels of intrinsic variations into account.

We used several criteria to probe different origins for the radial-velocity variations – stellar activity (spots, pulsations) or companions: bisector shape, radial-velocity variations amplitudes, and timescales.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}1) Sixty-four percent of the 170 stars with enough data points are found to be variable. Twenty are found to be binaries or candidate binaries (with stars or brown dwarfs). More than 80\% of the latest type stars (once binaries are removed), are intrinsically variable at a 2 m s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} precision level. Stars with earlier spectral type ( {\textless}i{\textgreater}≤{\textless}i/{\textgreater} 0.2) are either variable or associated to levels of uncertainties comparable to the RV rms observed on variable stars of the same . 2) We detected one long-period planetary system (presented in another paper) around an F6IV-V star. 3) We quantified the jitter due to stellar activity and we show that when taking this jitter into account in addition to the stellar parameters (spectral type, {\textless}i{\textgreater}v{\textless}i/{\textgreater} sin {\textless}i{\textgreater}i{\textless}i/{\textgreater}), it is still possible to detect planets with HARPS with periods of 3 days (resp. 10 days and 100 days) on 91\% (resp. 83\%, 61\%) of them. We show that even the earliest spectral type stars are accessible to this type of search, provided they have a low projected rotational velocity and low levels of activity. 4) Taking the present data into account, we computed the actually achieved detection limits for 107 targets and discuss the limits as a function of . Given the data at hand, our survey is sensitive to short-period (few days) planets and to longer ones (100 days) to a lower extent (latest type stars). We derive first constrains on the presence of planets around A-F stars for these ranges of periods.},

The purpose is to reduce memory and to speed-up computations by a multiresolution representation of the numerical solution on adaptive grids which are introduced by suitable thresholding of its wavelet coefficients. Further speed-up is obtained by the combination of the multiresolution scheme with an adaptive strategy for time integration, which is classical for ODE simulations. It considers variable time steps, controlled by a given precision, using embedded Runge–Kutta schemes. As an alternative to the celebrated CFL condition, the aim in the application of such an time-adaptive scheme for PDE simulations is to obtain accurate and safe integrations. The efficiency of this adaptive space-time method is analyzed in applications to typical Riemann–Lax test problems for the compressible Euler equations in one and two space dimensions. The results show that the accuracy properties of the reference finite volume scheme on the finest regular grid, where the time step is determined by the CFL condition, is preserved. Nevertheless, both CPU time and memory requirements are considerably reduced, thanks to the efficient self-adaptive grid refinement and controlled time-stepping.},

However, these methods may converge very slowly when utilizing a constant step size, or when employing an exact line search at each step, with the iteration count growing proportionally to the condition number. Faster gradient descent methods must occasionally resort to significantly larger step sizes, which in turn yields a strongly nonmonotone decrease pattern in the residual vector norm.In fact, such faster gradient descent methods generate chaotic dynamical systems for the normalized residual vectors. Very little is required to generate chaos here: simply damping steepest descent by a constant factor close to 1 will do. The fastest practical methods of this family in general appear to be the chaotic, two-step ones. Despite their erratic behavior, these methods may also be used as smoothers, or regularization operators. Our results also highlight the need for better theory for these methods.},

The hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods we introduce here add to these advantages their distinctive feature, namely, that the only globally-coupled degrees of freedom are those of the approximate trace of the scalar unknown.

	abstract = {In arXiv:1112.4297, we studied the propagation, observation, and control properties of the 1D wave equation on a bounded interval semi-discretized in space using the quadratic classical finite element approximation. It was shown that the discrete wave dynamics consisting of the interaction of nodal and midpoint components leads to the existence of two different eigenvalue branches in the spectrum: an acoustic one, of physical nature, and an optic one, of spurious nature. The fact that both dispersion relations have critical points where the corresponding group velocities vanish produces numerical wave packets whose energy is concentrated in the interior of the domain, without propagating, and for which the observability constant blows up as the mesh size goes to zero. This extends to the quadratic finite element setting the fact that the classical property of continuous waves being observable from the boundary fails for the most classical approximations on uniform meshes (finite differences, linear finite elements, etc.). As a consequence, the numerical controls of minimal norm may blow up as the mesh size parameter tends to zero. To cure these high-frequency pathologies, in arXiv:1112.4297 we designed a filtering mechanism consisting in taking piecewise linear and continuous initial data (so that the curvature component vanishes at the initial time) with nodal components given by a bi-grid algorithm. The aim of this article is to implement this filtering technique and to show numerically its efficiency.},

	abstract = {The optical behaviour of a surface carrying a transition layer is discussed, as a problem in scattering. The results are given of the application of electromagnetic theory to the case of a single parallel-sided film. Methods are given for extending this treatment to the case of multiple parallel-sided layers. Both analytical and graphical solutions are considered. Features governing the design of certain multilayer systems are given. A survey is made of the many methods now available for the determination of the thickness and optical constants of materials in the form of thin films. The range, accuracy and conditions of application of the various methods are summarized. A selection of the results obtained on a range of metallic and dielectric films is made and the basis of interpretation of these results is given. It is shown that the apparently anomalous variations of the optical constants of metal films with film thickness can be attributed to the granular nature of such films. Although less spectacular variations are observed in the properties of dielectric films, it is seen that for some materials the optical behaviour suggests the presence of marked inhomogeneity and anisotropy. Films formed chemically and electrolytically are briefly mentioned. Recent methods of controlling the thickness of films during deposition are given, together with a selection of the more important applications of thin films in optics. These include anti-reflecting and high reflecting systems, narrow-band, wide-band and cut-on multilayer filters, the use of thin films in polarizing systems and the application of thin films in heat-absorbing systems.},

In addition, the THz and IR absorption spectra of these two isomers’ aqueous solutions were also compared and explored. No obvious differences were found from their IR absorption features measured at room temperature, while their THz absorption spectra do have the differences, indicating THz characteristic absorption spectra more suitable for the detection and identification of aqueous glucose and fructose solutions. The results are helpful to understand the influence of aqueous solutions environment on the molecular structures and vibrational modes of the materials, and also provide a theoretical reference for the quantum chemical calculation of biological macromolecules.},

The terahertz radiations are invisible to naked eye \& in comparison with X-ray they are intrinsically safe, non-destructive and non-invasive. This is such a new field that researchers around the world race to build the first practical system. It resolves many of the questions left unanswered by complementary techniques, such as optical imaging, Raman and infrared. Terahertz spectroscopy has number of applications run from detecting defects in tablet coating, product inspection (industry), spectroscopy (chemistry, astronomy), material characterization (physics), weapons concealed under clothing (airports), detection of cancer and caries. In the pharmaceutical industries it enables nondestructive, internal, chemical analysis of tablets, capsules and other dosage forms. This paper tries therefore not only to provide a brief overview over the imaging technology, but also over the whole range of current systems and research in terahertz technology.},

	abstract = {We present new observations of the planet beta Pictoris b from 2018 with GPI, the first GPI observations following conjunction. Based on these new measurements, we perform a joint orbit fit to the available relative astrometry from ground-based imaging, the Hipparcos Intermediate Astrometric Data (IAD), and the Gaia DR2 position, and demonstrate how to incorporate the IAD into direct imaging orbit fits. We find a mass consistent with predictions of hot-start evolutionary models and previous works following similar methods, though with larger uncertainties: 12.8 [+5.3, -3.2] M\_Jup. Our eccentricity determination of 0.12 [+0.04, -0.03] disfavors circular orbits. We consider orbit fits to several different imaging datasets, and find generally similar posteriors on the mass for each combination of imaging data. Our analysis underscores the importance of performing joint fits to the absolute and relative astrometry simultaneously, given the strong covariance between orbital elements. Time of conjunction is well constrained within 2.8 days of 2017 September 13, with the star behind the planet's Hill sphere between 2017 April 11 and 2018 February 16 (+/- 18 days). Following the recent radial velocity detection of a second planet in the system, beta Pic c, we perform additional two-planet fits combining relative astrometry, absolute astrometry, and stellar radial velocities. These joint fits find a significantly smaller mass for the imaged planet beta Pic b, of 8.0 +/- 2.6 M\_Jup, in a somewhat more circular orbit. We expect future ground-based observations to further constrain the visual orbit and mass of the planet in advance of the release of Gaia DR4.},

	abstract = {Gas-giant planets that form via core accretion might have very different characteristics from those that form via disk instability. Disk-instability objects are typically thought to have higher entropies, larger radii, and (generally) higher effective temperatures than core-accretion objects. In this paper, we provide a large set of models exploring the observational consequences of high-entropy (hot) and low-entropy (cold) initial conditions, in the hope that this will ultimately help to distinguish between different physical mechanisms of planet formation. However, the exact entropies and radii of newly formed planets due to these two modes of formation cannot, at present, be precisely predicted. It is possible that the distribution of properties of core-accretion-formed planets and the distribution of properties of disk-instability-formed planets overlap. We, therefore, introduce a broad range of “warm-start” gas-giant planet models. Between the hottest and the coldest models that we consider, differences in radii, temperatures, luminosities, and spectra persist for only a few million to a few tens of millions of years for planets that are a few times Jupiter's mass or less. For planets that are ∼five times Jupiter's mass or more, significant differences between hottest-start and coldest-start models persist for on the order of 100 Myr. We find that out of the standard infrared bands (J, H, K, L′, M, N) the K and H bands are the most diagnostic of the initial conditions. A hottest-start model can be from ∼4.5 mag brighter (at Jupiter's mass) to ∼9 mag brighter (at 10 times Jupiter's mass) than a coldest-start model in the first few million years. In more massive objects, these large differences in luminosity and spectrum persist for much longer than in less massive objects. Finally, we consider the influence of atmospheric conditions on spectra, and find that the presence or absence of clouds, and the metallicity of an atmosphere, can affect an object's apparent brightness in different bands by up to several magnitudes.},

The history and composition of the parent bodies can therefore be revealed by determining the spatial distribution, grain size, composition and crystallinity of the dust through high-resolution mid-infrared observations. Here we report that the sub-micrometre amorphous silicate grains around β Pic have peaks in their distribution around 6, 16 and 30 au (1 au is the Sun–Earth distance), whereas the crystalline and micrometre-sized amorphous silicate grains are concentrated in the disk centre. As sub-micrometre grains are blown quickly out from the system by radiation pressure from the central star, the peaks indicate the locations of ongoing dust replenishment, which originates from ring-like distributions of planetesimals or ‘planetesimal belts’.},

	abstract = {With the discovery of planets beyond our solar system 25 years ago, exoplanet research has expanded dramatically, with new state-of-the-art ground-based and space-based missions dedicated to their discovery and characterisation. With more than 3,500 exoplanets now known, the complexity of the discovery techniques, observations and physical characterisation have grown exponentially. This Handbook ties all these avenues of research together across a broad range of exoplanet science. Planet formation, exoplanet interiors and atmospheres, and habitability are discussed, providing in-depth coverage of our knowledge to date. Comprehensively updated from the first edition, it includes instrumental and observational developments, in-depth treatment of the new Kepler mission results and hot Jupiter atmospheric studies, and major updates on models of exoplanet formation. With extensive references to the research literature and appendices covering all individual exoplanet discoveries, it is a valuable reference to this exciting field for both incoming and established researchers.},

SciPy has become a de facto standard for leveraging scientific algorithms in the Python programming language, with more than 600 unique code contributors, thousands of dependent packages, over 100,000 dependent repositories, and millions of downloads per year. This includes usage of SciPy in almost half of all machine learning projects on GitHub, and usage by high profile projects including LIGO gravitational wave analysis and creation of the first-ever image of a black hole (M87). The library includes functionality spanning clustering, Fourier transforms, integration, interpolation, file I/O, linear algebra, image processing, orthogonal distance regression, minimization algorithms, signal processing, sparse matrix handling, computational geometry, and statistics. In this work, we provide an overview of the capabilities and development practices of the SciPy library and highlight some recent technical developments.},

A high degree of variability was found in many characteristics, often exceeding an order of magnitude. Syrups were categorized based on light transmission at 560 nm into amber (12), dark (13) and very dark (10) using International Maple Syrup Institute (IMSI) guidelines. No statistical differences were found among grades of syrup for density, pH, TSS, glucose, fructose, total reducing sugars, glucose:fructose ratio, magnesium, manganese or potassium. Darker syrups showed significantly higher autofluorescence, total phenol content, antioxidant potential, phosphorous, calcium and total mineral content. Significant negative correlations of percent transmission with total phenol content, antioxidant potential and total mineral content are reported. Significant positive correlations among total phenol content, antioxidant potential and total mineral content are also described.

	abstract = {This paper presents SOAP 2.0, a new version of the Spot Oscillation And Planet (SOAP) code that estimates in a simple way the photometric and radial velocity (RV) variations induced by active regions. The inhibition of the convective blueshift (CB) inside active regions is considered, as well as the limb brightening effect of plages, a quadratic limb darkening law, and a realistic spot and plage contrast ratio. SOAP 2.0 shows that the activity-induced variation of plages is dominated by the inhibition of the CB effect. For spots, this effect becomes significant only for slow rotators. In addition, in the case of a major active region dominating the activity-induced signal, the ratio between the FWHM and the RV peak-to-peak amplitudes of the cross correlation function can be used to infer the type of active region responsible for the signal for stars with v sin i ⩽8 km s–1. A ratio smaller than three implies a spot, while a larger ratio implies a plage. Using the observation of HD 189733, we show that SOAP 2.0 manages to reproduce the activity variation as well as previous simulations when a spot is dominating the activity-induced variation. In addition, SOAP 2.0 also reproduces the activity variation induced by a plage on the slowly rotating star α Cen B, which is not possible using previous simulations. Following these results, SOAP 2.0 can be used to estimate the signal induced by spots and plages, but also to correct for it when a major active region is dominating the RV variation.},

In case the exoplanet host star shows pulsations, asteroseismology can be used for an improved description of the stellar parameters. We aim to revisit the pulsational properties of beta Pic and identify its pulsation modes from normalised amplitudes in five different passbands. We also investigate the potential presence of a magnetic field. We conduct a frequency analysis using three seasons of BRITE-Constellation observations in the BRITE blue and red filters, the {\textasciitilde}620-day long bRing light curve and the nearly 8-year long SMEI photometric time series. We calculate normalised amplitudes using all passbands including previously published values obtained from ASTEP observations. We investigate the magnetic properties of beta Pic using spectropolarimetric observations conducted with the HARPSpol instrument. Using 2D rotating models, we fit the normalised amplitudes and frequencies through Monte Carlo Markov Chains. We identify 15 pulsation frequencies in the range from 34 to 55c/d, where two display clear amplitude variability. We use the normalised amplitudes in up to five passbands to identify the modes as three l = 1, six l = 2 and six l = 3 modes. beta Pic is shown to be non-magnetic with an upper limit of the possible undetected dipolar field of 300G. Multiple fits to the frequencies and normalised amplitudes are obtained including one with a near equator-on inclination for beta Pic, which corresponds to our expectations based on the orbital inclination of beta Pic b and the orientation of the circumstellar disk. This solution leads to a rotation rate of 27\% of the Keplerian break-up velocity, a radius of 1.497+-0.025Rsun, and a mass of 1.797+-0.035Msun. The {\textasciitilde}2\% errors in radius and mass do not account for uncertainties in the models and a potentially erroneous mode-identification.},

	abstract = {We use a simple organism lifecycle model to explore the viability of an atmospheric habitable zone (AHZ), with temperatures that could support Earth-centric life, which sits above an environment that does not support life. To illustrate our model, we use a cool Y dwarf atmosphere, such as WISE J085510.83–0714442.5, whose 4.5–5.2 μm spectrum shows absorption features consistent with water vapor and clouds. We allow organisms to adapt to their atmospheric environment (described by temperature, convection, and gravity) by adopting different growth strategies that maximize their chance of survival and proliferation. We assume a constant upward vertical velocity through the AHZ. We found that the organism growth strategy is most sensitive to the magnitude of the atmospheric convection. Stronger convection supports the evolution of more massive organisms. For a purely radiative environment, we find that evolved organisms have a mass that is an order of magnitude smaller than terrestrial microbes, thereby defining a dynamical constraint on the dimensions of life that an AHZ can support. Based on a previously defined statistical approach, we infer that there are of the order of 109 cool Y brown dwarfs in the Milky Way, and likely a few tens of these objects are within 10 pc from Earth. Our work also has implications for exploring life in the atmospheres of temperate gas giants. Consideration of the habitable volumes in planetary atmospheres significantly increases the volume of habitable space in the galaxy.},

Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

We give advice on method choice, tuning for performance, methods for initialization, tests of convergence, troubleshooting, and use of the chain output to produce or report parameter estimates with associated uncertainties. We argue that autocorrelation time is the most important test for convergence, as it directly connects to the uncertainty on the sampling estimate of any quantity of interest.

The most popular solution in this case is to use the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Lomb-Scargle{\textless}i/{\textgreater} periodogram, but this method can be used only when the noise is the realization of a zero-mean, white (i.e. flat-spectrum) random process.

However, the nonlinear density functions encountered in these problems can make MCMC time-consuming. In this paper, we apply an ensemble sampler respecting affine invariance to orbital parameter extraction from radial velocity data. This new sampler has only one free parameter, and does not require much tuning for good performance, which is important for automatization. The autocorrelation time of this sampler is approximately the same for all parameters and far smaller than Metropolis-Hastings, which means it requires many fewer function calls to produce the same number of independent samples. The affine-invariant sampler speeds up MCMC by hundreds of times compared with Metropolis-Hastings in the same computing situation. This novel sampler would be ideal for projects involving large data sets such as statistical investigations of planet distribution. The biggest obstacle to ensemble samplers is the existence of multiple local optima; we present a clustering technique to deal with local optima by clustering based on the likelihood of the walkers in the ensemble. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the sampler on real radial velocity data.},

However, the 376 day orbit, with an eccentricity of 0.10, is formally more probable because for this sparse data set there is a much larger volume of parameter space with a significant probability density in the vicinity of the 376 day peak. The previously reported orbit (Tinney et al. 2003) of 190.5 ± 3.0 days corresponds to our least probable orbit.

Radial velocities obtained with Magellan/PFS and TNG/HARPS-N show evidence for stellar activity along with orbital motion. We determined the planetary mass using two different methods: (1) the “floating chunk offset” method, based only on changes in velocity observed on the same night; and (2) a Gaussian process regression based on both the radial velocity and photometric time series. The results are consistent and lead to a mass measurement of and a mean density of g cm−3.},

	abstract = {Precise radial velocity measurements have led to the discovery of ∼100 extrasolar planetary systems. We investigate the uncertainty in the orbital solutions that have been fitted to these observations. Understanding these uncertainties will become more and more important as the discovery space for extrasolar planets shifts to longer and longer periods. While detections of short-period planets can be rapidly refined, planets with long orbital periods will require observations spanning decades to constrain the orbital parameters precisely. Already in some cases, multiple distinct orbital solutions provide similarly good fits, particularly in multiple-planet systems. We present a method for quantifying the uncertainties in orbital fits and addressing specific questions directly from the observational data rather than relying on best-fit orbital solutions. This Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique has the advantage that it is well suited to the high-dimensional parameter spaces necessary for the multiple-planet systems. We apply the MCMC technique to several extrasolar planetary systems, assessing the uncertainties in orbital elements for several systems. Our MCMC simulations demonstrate that for some systems there are strong correlations between orbital parameters and/or significant non-Gaussianities in parameter distributions, even though the measurement errors are nearly Gaussian. Once these effects are considered, the actual uncertainties in orbital elements can be significantly larger or smaller than the published uncertainties. We also present simple applications of our methods, such as predicting the times of possible transits for GJ 876.},

	abstract = {The growing field of large-scale time domain astronomy requires methods for probabilistic data analysis that are computationally tractable, even with large data sets. Gaussian processes (GPs) are a popular class of models used for this purpose, but since the computational cost scales, in general, as the cube of the number of data points, their application has been limited to small data sets. In this paper, we present a novel method for GPs modeling in one dimension where the computational requirements scale linearly with the size of the data set. We demonstrate the method by applying it to simulated and real astronomical time series data sets. These demonstrations are examples of probabilistic inference of stellar rotation periods, asteroseismic oscillation spectra, and transiting planet parameters. The method exploits structure in the problem when the covariance function is expressed as a mixture of complex exponentials, without requiring evenly spaced observations or uniform noise. This form of covariance arises naturally when the process is a mixture of stochastically driven damped harmonic oscillators—providing a physical motivation for and interpretation of this choice—but we also demonstrate that it can be a useful effective model in some other cases. We present a mathematical description of the method and compare it to existing scalable GP methods. The method is fast and interpretable, with a range of potential applications within astronomical data analysis and beyond. We provide well-tested and documented open-source implementations of this method in C++, Python, and Julia.},

	abstract = {In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. These problems pose a special challenge to the field of global optimization, since existing methods often require more function evaluations than can be comfortably afforded. One way to address this challenge is to fit response surfaces to data collected by evaluating the objective and constraint functions at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization, tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response surface methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can be used to construct an efficient global optimization algorithm with a credible stopping rule. The key to using response surfaces for global optimization lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where prediction error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems which have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational obstacles can be overcome.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a cross-calibrated catalog of Hipparcos and Gaia astrometry to enable their use in measuring changes in proper motion, i.e., accelerations in the plane of the sky. The final catalog adopts the reference frame of the second Gaia data release (DR2) and locally cross-calibrates both the scaled Hipparcos–Gaia DR2 positional differences and the Hipparcos proper motions themselves to this frame. This gives three nearly independent proper motion measurements per star, with the scaled positional difference usually being the most precise. We find that a linear combination of the two Hipparcos reductions is superior to either reduction on its own and address error inflation for both Hipparcos and Gaia DR2. Our adopted error inflation is additive (in quadrature) for Hipparcos and multiplicative for Gaia. We provide the covariance matrices along with the central epochs of all measurements. Our final proper motion differences are accurately Gaussian with the appropriate variances and are suitable for acceleration measurements and orbit fitting. The catalog is constructed with an eye toward completeness; it contains nearly 98\% of the Hipparcos stars. It also includes a handful of spurious entries and a few stars with poor Hipparcos reductions that the user must vet by hand. Statistical distributions of accelerations derived from this catalog should be interpreted with caution.},

Later, a planetary mass companion to the star, {\textless}i{\textgreater}β{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Pic b, was identified using imagery. Observations at different epochs (2003 and 2009–2015) detected the planet at a projected distance of 6 to 9 AU from the star and showed that the planet is on an edge-on orbit. The observed motion is consistent with an inferior conjunction in 1981, and {\textless}i{\textgreater}β{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Pic b can be the transiting planet proposed to explain the photometric event observed at that time. Assuming that the 1981 event is related to the transit or the inferior conjunction of {\textless}i{\textgreater}β{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Pic b on an edge-on orbit, we search for the planetary orbit in agreement with all the measurements of the planet position published so far. We find two different orbits that are compatible with all these constraints: (i) an orbit with a period of 17.97 ± 0.08 years along with an eccentricity of around 0.12 and (ii) an orbit with a period of 36.38 ± 0.13 years and a larger eccentricity of about 0.32. In the near future, new imaging observations should allow us to discriminate between these two different orbits. We also estimate the possible dates for the next transits, which could take place as early as 2017 or 2018, even for a long-period orbit.},

	abstract = {We measure dynamical masses for five objects--three ultracool dwarfs, one low-mass star, and one white dwarf--by fitting orbits to a combination of the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of Accelerations, literature radial velocities, and relative astrometry. Our approach provides precise masses without any assumptions about the primary star, even though the observations typically cover only a small fraction of an orbit. We also perform a uniform re-analysis of the host stars' ages. Two of our objects, HD 4747B and HR 7672B, already have precise dynamical masses near the stellar/substellar boundary and are used to validate our approach. For Gl 758B, we obtain a mass of \$m=38.1\_\{-1.5\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.7\}\$ \$M\_\{Jup\}\$, the most precise mass measurement of this companion to date. Gl 758B is the coldest brown dwarf with a dynamical mass, and the combination of our low mass and slightly older host-star age resolves its previously noted discrepancy with substellar evolutionary models. HD 68017B, a late-M dwarf, has a mass of \$m=0.147{\textbackslash}pm 0.003\$ \$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, consistent with stellar theory and previous empirical estimates based on its absolute magnitude. The progenitor of the white dwarf Gl 86B has been debated in the literature, and our dynamical measurement of \$m=0.595 {\textbackslash}pm 0.010\$ \$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ is consistent with a higher progenitor mass and younger age for this planet-hosting binary system. Overall, these case studies represent only five of the thousands of accelerating systems identified by combining Hipparcos and Gaia.

For the most recent system age estimate (21 ± 4 Myr), the bolometric luminosity and the constraints on the dynamical mass of {\textless}i{\textgreater}β{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Pic b are only reproduced by warm- and hot-start tracks with initial entropies {\textless}i{\textgreater}S{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}i{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}{\textgreater} 10.5 {\textless}i{\textgreater}k{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}B{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}/{\textless}i{\textgreater}baryon{\textless}i/{\textgreater}.

The high dynamic range of our observations allows us to measure the relative position of β Pic b with respect to its primary star with greater accuracy than previous observations. Based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, we find the planet has an orbital semi-major axis of 9.1 AU and orbital eccentricity {\textless}0.15 at 68\% confidence (with 95\% confidence intervals of 8.2-48 AU and 0.00-0.82 for semi-major axis and eccentricity, respectively, due to a long narrow degenerate tail between the two). We find that the planet has reached its maximum projected elongation, enabling higher precision determination of the orbital parameters than previously possible, and that the planet's projected separation is currently decreasing. With unsaturated data of the entire β Pic system (primary star, planet, and disk) obtained thanks to NICI's semi-transparent focal plane mask, we are able to tightly constrain the relative orientation of the circumstellar components. We find the orbital plane of the planet lies between the inner and outer disks: the position angle (P.A.) of nodes for the planet's orbit (211.8 ± 0.°3) is 7.4σ greater than the P.A. of the spine of the outer disk and 3.2σ less than the warped inner disk P.A., indicating the disk is not collisionally relaxed.

Here we report near-infrared spectroscopic observations, at a resolving power of 100,000, of the young extrasolar gas giant planet β Pictoris b (refs 7, 8). The absorption signal from carbon monoxide in the planet’s thermal spectrum is found to be blueshifted with respect to that from the parent star by approximately 15 kilometres per second, consistent with a circular orbit9. The combined line profile exhibits a rotational broadening of about 25 kilometres per second, meaning that β Pictoris b spins significantly faster than any planet in the Solar System, in line with the extrapolation of the known trend in spin velocity with planet mass.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} In June 2010, we confirmed the existence of a giant planet in the disk of the young star {\textless}i{\textgreater}β{\textless}i/{\textgreater}Pictoris located between 8 AU and 15 AU from the star. This young planet offers the rare opportunity to monitor a large fraction of the orbit using the imaging technique over a reasonably short timescale. It also offers the opportunity to study its atmospheric properties using spectroscopy and multi-band photometry, and possibly derive its dynamical mass by combining imaging with radial velocity data to set tight constraints on giant planet formation theories.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We aim to measure the evolution of the planet’s position relative to the star {\textless}i{\textgreater}β{\textless}i/{\textgreater}Pictoris to determine the planetary orbital properties. Our ultimate goal is to relate both the planetary orbital configuration and physical properties to either the disk structure or the cometary activity observed for decades in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}β{\textless}i/{\textgreater}Pictoris system.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Using the NAOS-CONICA adaptive-optics instrument (NACO) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT), we obtained repeated follow-up images of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}β{\textless}i/{\textgreater}Pictoris system in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}s{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}L{\textless}i/{\textgreater}′ filters at four new epochs in 2010 and 2011. Complementing these data with previous measurements, we conduct a homogeneous analysis, which covers more than eight yrs, to accurately monitor the {\textless}i{\textgreater}β{\textless}i/{\textgreater}Pictoris b position relative to the star. We then carefully consider the various sources of uncertainties that may affect the orbital parameter determination.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} On the basis of the evolution of the planet’s relative position with time, we derive the best-fit orbital solutions for our measurements using two fitting methods, a least squares Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and a Markov-chain Monte Carlo approach. More reliable results are found with the second approach as our measurements do not cover the complete planetary orbit, and are biased toward the most recent epochs since the planet recovery. The solutions favor a low-eccentricity orbit {\textless}i{\textgreater}e{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ≲ 0.17, with semi-major axis in the range 8–9 AU corresponding to orbital periods of 17–21 yrs. Our solutions favor a highly inclined solution with a peak around {\textless}i{\textgreater}i{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 88.5 ± 1.7°, and a longitude of ascending node tightly constrained at Ω = −147.5 ± 1.5°. These results indicate that the orbital plane of the planet is likely to be above the midplane of the main disk, and compatible with the warp component of the disk being tilted between 3.5 deg and 4.0 deg. This suggests that the planet plays a key role in the origin of the inner warped-disk morphology of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}β{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Pic disk. Finally, these orbital parameters are consistent with the hypothesis that the planet is responsible for the transit-like event observed in November 1981, and also linked to the cometary activity observed in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}β{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Pic system.},

	abstract = {Only 235 entries were processed as astrometric binaries with orbits in the Hipparcos and Tycho Catalogue (ESA 1997). However, the Intermediate Astrometric Data (IAD) and Transit Data (TD) made available by ESA make it possible to re-process the stars that turned out to be spectroscopic binaries after the completion of the Catalogue. This paper illustrates how TD and IAD may be used in conjunction with the orbital parameters of spectroscopic binaries to derive astrometric parameters. The five astrometric and four orbital parameters (not already known from the spectroscopic orbit) are derived by minimizing an objective function () with an algorithm of global optimization. This code has been applied to 81 systems for which spectroscopic orbits became available recently and that belong to various families of chemically-peculiar red giants (namely, dwarf barium stars, strong and mild barium stars, CH stars, and Tc-poor S stars). Among these 81 systems, 23 yield reliable astrometric orbits. These 23 systems make it possible to evaluate on real data the so-called “cosmic error” described by Wielen et al. (1997), namely the fact that an unrecognized orbital motion introduces a systematic error on the proper motion. Comparison of the proper motion from the Hipparcos catalogue with that re-derived in the present work indicates that the former are indeed far off the present value for binaries with periods in the range 3 to {\textasciitilde} 8 years. Hipparcos parallaxes of unrecognized spectroscopic binaries turn out to be reliable, except for systems with periods close to 1 year, as expected. Finally, we show that, even when a complete orbital revolution was observed by Hipparcos, the inclination is unfortunately seldom precise.},

Comparing the empirical measurement of the bolometric luminosity to evolutionary models, we find a mass of 12.9 ± 0.2 , an effective temperature of 1724 ± 15 K, a radius of 1.46 ± 0.01 , and a surface gravity of [dex] (cgs).

Using atmospheric models, we find an effective temperature of 1700–1800 K and a surface gravity of –4.0 [dex] depending upon the model. These values agree well with other publications and with “hot-start” predictions from planetary evolution models. Further, we find that the spectrum of β Pic b best matches a low surface gravity L2 ± 1 brown dwarf.

It is surrounded by a prominent and complex debris disk that is likely stirred by one or several gas giant exoplanets. The discovery of the RV signature of a giant exoplanet was announced 15 yr ago, but has met with scrutiny due to possible confusion with stellar noise. We confirm the planet with a new compilation and analysis of precise RV data spanning 30 yr, and combine it with upper limits from our direct imaging search, the most sensitive ever performed. The deep images were taken in the Ms band (4.7 μm) with the vortex coronagraph recently installed in W.M. Keck Observatory’s infrared camera NIRC2, which opens a sensitive window for planet searches around nearby adolescent systems. The RV data and direct imaging upper limit maps were combined in an innovative joint Bayesian analysis, providing new constraints on the mass and orbital parameters of the elusive planet. ϵ Eridani b has a mass of M Jup and is orbiting ϵ Eridani at about 3.48 ± 0.02 au with a period of 7.37 ± 0.07 yr. The eccentricity of ϵ Eridani b’s orbit is , an order of magnitude smaller than early estimates and consistent with a circular orbit.

Thus it offers unique opportunities for detailed studies of its orbital, physical, and atmospheric properties, and of disk-planet interactions. With the exception of the discovery observations in 2003 with NaCo at the Very Large Telescope (VLT), all following astrometric measurements relative to {\textless}i{\textgreater}β{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Pictoris have been obtained in the southwestern part of the orbit, which severely limits the determination of the planet’s orbital parameters.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims{\textless}i/{\textgreater}.

We were able to monitor the planet until November 2016, when its angular separation became too small (125 mas, i.e., 1.6 au) and prevented further detection. We redetected {\textless}i{\textgreater}β{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Pictoris b on the northeast side of the disk at a separation of 139 mas and a PA of 30° in September 2018. The planetary orbit is now well constrained. With a semi-major axis (sma) of {\textless}i{\textgreater}a{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 9.0 ± 0.5 au (1{\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}), it definitely excludes previously reported possible long orbital periods, and excludes {\textless}i{\textgreater}β{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Pictoris b as the origin of photometric variations that took place in 1981. We also refine the eccentricity and inclination of the planet. From an instrumental point of view, these data demonstrate that it is possible to detect, if they exist, young massive Jupiters that orbit at less than 2 au from a star that is 20 pc away.},

	abstract = {Methods. Orbiting secondary bodies inﬂuence the proper motion of their parent star through their gravitational reﬂex motion. Using the Hipparcos and Gaia’s second data release (GDR2) catalogs, we determined the long-term proper motion of the stars common to these two catalogs. We then searched for a proper motion anomaly (PMa) between the long-term proper motion vector and the GDR2 (or Hipparcos) measurements, indicative of the presence of a perturbing secondary object. We focussed our analysis on the 6741 nearby stars located within 50 pc, and we also present a catalog of the PMa for 99\% of the Hipparcos catalog (≈117 000 stars).
Results. 30\% of the stars studied present a PMa greater than 3σ. The PMa allows us to detect orbiting companions, or set stringent limits on their presence. We present a few illustrations of the PMa analysis to interesting targets. We set upper limits of 0.1−0.3 MJ to potential planets orbiting Proxima between 1 and 10 au (Porb = 3 to 100 years). We conﬁrm that Proxima is gravitationally bound to α Cen. We recover the masses of the known companions of Eri, Ind, Ross 614 and β Pic. We also detect the signature of a possible planet of a few Jovian masses orbiting τ Ceti.
Conclusions. Based on only 22 months of data, the GDR2 has limitations. But its combination with the Hipparcos catalog results in very high accuracy PMa vectors, that already enable us to set valuable constraints on the binarity of nearby objects. The detection of tangential velocity anomalies at a median accuracy of σ(∆vT) = 1.0 m s−1 per parsec of distance is already possible with the GDR2. This type of analysis opens the possibility to identify long period orbital companions otherwise inaccessible. For long orbital periods, Gaia’s complementarity to radial velocity and transit techniques (that are more sensitive to short orbital periods) already appears to be remarkably powerful.},

Our mass uncertainty is somewhat higher than previous work because our astrometry from the Hipparcos–Gaia Catalog of Accelerations accounts for the error inflation and systematic terms that are required to bring the two data sets onto a common astrometric reference frame, and because we fit freely for the host-star mass (1.84 ± 0.05 M ⊙). This first model-independent mass for a directly imaged planet is inconsistent with cold-start models given the age of the β Pic moving group (22 ± 6 Myr) but consistent with hot- and warm-start models, concordant with past work. We find a higher eccentricity (0.24 ± 0.06) for β Pic b compared to previous orbital fits. If confirmed by future observations, this eccentricity may help explain inner edge, scale height, and brightness asymmetry of β Pic’s disk. It could also potentially signal that β Pic b has migrated inward to its current location, acquiring its eccentricity from interaction with the 3:1 outer Lindblad resonance in the disk.},

	abstract = {Binks \& Jeffries and Malo et al. have recently reported Li depletion boundary (LDB) ages for the β Pictoris moving group (BPMG) which are twice as old as the oft-cited kinematic age of ∼12 Myr. In this study, we present (1) a new evaluation of the internal kinematics of the BPMG using the revised Hipparcos astrometry and best available published radial velocities, and assess whether a useful kinematic age can be derived, and (2) derive an isochronal age based on the placement of the A-, F-, and G-type stars in the colour–magnitude diagram (CMD). We explore the kinematics of the BPMG looking at velocity trends along Galactic axes, and conducting traceback analyses assuming linear trajectories, epicyclic orbit approximation, and orbit integration using a realistic gravitational potential. None of the methodologies yield a kinematic age with small uncertainties using modern velocity data. Expansion in the Galactic X and Y directions is signiﬁcant only at the 1.7σ and 2.7σ levels, and together yields an overall kinematic age with a wide range (13–58 Myr; 95 per cent CL). The A-type members are all on the zero-age main sequence, suggestive of an age of {\textgreater}20 Myr, and the loci of the CMD positions for the late-F- and G-type pre-main-sequence BPMG members have a median isochronal age of 22 Myr (± 3 Myr statistical, ±1 Myr systematic) when considering four sets of modern theoretical isochrones. The results from recent LDB and isochronal age analyses are now in agreement with a median BPMG age of 23 ± 3 Myr (overall 1σ uncertainty, including ±2 Myr statistical and ±2 Myr systematic uncertainties).},

	abstract = {Precise radial velocity measurements have led to the discovery of \$170 extrasolar planetary systems. Understanding the uncertainties in the orbital solutions will become increasingly important as the discovery space for extrasolar planets shifts to planets with smaller masses and longer orbital periods. The method of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) provides a rigorous method for quantifying the uncertainties in orbital parameters in a Bayesian framework (Paper I). The main practical challenge for the general application of MCMC is the need to construct Markov chains that quickly converge. The rate of convergence is very sensitive to the choice of the candidate transition probability distribution function (CTPDF). Here we explain one simple method for generating alternative CTPDFs that can signiﬁcantly speed convergence by 1–3 orders of magnitude. We have numerically tested dozens of CTPDFs with simulated radial velocity data sets to identify those that perform well for different types of orbits and suggest a set of CTPDFs for general application. In addition, we introduce other reﬁnements to the MCMC algorithm for radial velocity planets, including an improved treatment of the uncertainties in the radial velocity observations, an algorithm for automatically choosing step sizes, an algorithm for automatically determining reasonable stopping times, and the use of importance sampling for including the dynamical evolution of multiple-planet systems. Together, these improvements make it practical to apply MCMC to multiple-planet systems. We demonstrate the improvements in efﬁciency by analyzing a variety of extrasolar planetary systems.},

This article examines several new and old information criteria (IC) that approximate Bayes factors. We compare these IC measures to common ﬁt indices in a simulation that includes the true and false models. In moderate to large samples, the IC measures outperform the ﬁt indices. In a second simulation we only consider the IC measures and do not include the true model. In moderate to large samples the IC measures favor approximate models that only differ from the true model by having extra parameters. Overall, SPBIC, a new IC measure, performs well relative to the other IC measures.},

	abstract = {[In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of probability, Jeffresy developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpies was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: From Jeffrey's Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. In "non-Bayesian significance tests. The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.]},

	abstract = {A number of problems in probability and statistics can be addressed using the multivariate normal (Gaussian) distribution. In the one-dimensional case, computing the probability for a given mean and variance simply requires the evaluation of the corresponding Gaussian density. In the n-dimensional setting, however, it requires the inversion of an n x n covariance matrix, C, as well as the evaluation of its determinant, det(C). In many cases, such as regression using Gaussian processes, the covariance matrix is of the form C = σ2I + K, where K is computed using a specified covariance kernel which depends on the data and additional parameters (hyperparameters). The matrix C is typically dense, causing standard direct methods for inversion and determinant evaluation to require O(n3) work. This cost is prohibitive for large-scale modeling. Here, we show that for the most commonly used covariance functions, the matrix C can be hierarchically factored into a product of block low-rank updates of the identity matrix, yielding an O(n log2n) algorithm for inversion. More importantly, we show that this factorization enables the evaluation of the determinant det(C), permitting the direct calculation of probabilities in high dimensions under fairly broad assumptions on the kernel defining K. Our fast algorithm brings many problems in marginalization and the adaptation of hyperparameters within practical reach using a single CPU core. The combination of nearly optimal scaling in terms of problem size with high-performance computing resources will permit the modeling of previously intractable problems. We illustrate the performance of the scheme on standard covariance kernels.},

	abstract = {M-dwarfs are known to commonly host high-multiplicity planetary systems. Therefore, M-dwarf planetary systems with a known transiting planet are expected to contain additional small planets ( r p ≤ 4 R ⊕ , m p ≲ 20 M ⊕ ) that are not seen in transit. In this study, we investigate the effort required to detect such planets using precision velocimetry around the sizable subset of M-dwarfs that are slowly rotating ( P rot ≳ 40 days), and hence more likely to be inactive. We focus on the test case of GJ 1132. Specifically, we perform a suite of Monte-Carlo simulations of the star’s radial velocity signal, featuring astrophysical contributions from stellar jitter due to rotationally modulated active regions, as well as Keplerian signals from the known transiting planet and hypothetical additional planets not seen in transit. We then compute the detection completeness of non-transiting planets around GJ 1132 and consequently estimate the number of RV measurements required to detect those planets. We show that, with 1 m s −1 precision per measurement, only ∼50 measurements are required to achieve a 50\% detection completeness for all non-transiting planets in the system, as well as planets that are potentially habitable. Throughout this work, we advocate the use of Gaussian process regression as an effective tool for mitigating the effects of stellar jitter including stars with high activity. Given that GJ 1132 is representative of a large population of slowly rotating M-dwarfs, we conclude with a discussion of how our results may be extended to other systems with known transiting planets, such as those that will be discovered with TESS .},

	abstract = {Kepler-78b is a transiting planet that is 1.2 times the radius of Earth and orbits a young, active K dwarf every 8 hr. The mass of Kepler-78b has been independently reported by two teams based on radial velocity (RV) measurements using the HIRES and HARPS-N spectrographs. Due to the active nature of the host star, a stellar activity model is required to distinguish and isolate the planetary signal in RV data. Whereas previous studies tested parametric stellar activity models, we modeled this system using nonparametric Gaussian process (GP) regression. We produced a GP regression of relevant Kepler photometry. We then use the posterior parameter distribution for our photometric fit as a prior for our simultaneous GP + Keplerian orbit models of the RV data sets. We tested three simple kernel functions for our GP regressions. Based on a Bayesian likelihood analysis, we selected a quasi-periodic kernel model with GP hyperparameters coupled between the two RV data sets, giving a Doppler amplitude of 1.86 ± 0.25 m s −1 and supporting our belief that the correlated noise we are modeling is astrophysical. The corresponding mass of \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/808/2/127/apj516681ieqn1.gif] \$1.87\_-0.26{\textasciicircum}+0.27{\textbackslash};M\_øplus \$ is consistent with that measured in previous studies, and more robust due to our nonparametric signal estimation.

	abstract = {A principal scientific goal of the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) is obtaining milliarcsecond astrometry to constrain exoplanet orbits. However, astrometry of directly imaged exoplanets is subject to biases, systematic errors, and speckle noise. Here, we describe an analytical procedure to forward model the signal of an exoplanet that accounts for both the observing strategy (angular and spectral differential imaging) and the data reduction method (Karhunen–Loève Image Projection algorithm). We use this forward model to measure the position of an exoplanet in a Bayesian framework employing Gaussian processes and Markov-chain Monte Carlo to account for correlated noise. In the case of GPI data on β Pic b, this technique, which we call Bayesian KLIP-FM Astrometry (BKA), outperforms previous techniques and yields 1 σ errors at or below the one milliarcsecond level. We validate BKA by fitting a Keplerian orbit to 12 GPI observations along with previous astrometry from other instruments. The statistical properties of the residuals confirm that BKA is accurate and correctly estimates astrometric errors. Our constraints on the orbit of β Pic b firmly rule out the possibility of a transit of the planet at 10- σ significance. However, we confirm that the Hill sphere of β Pic b will transit, giving us a rare chance to probe the circumplanetary environment of a young, evolving exoplanet. We provide an ephemeris for photometric monitoring of the Hill sphere transit event, which will begin at the start of April in 2017 and finish at the end of January in 2018.},

	abstract = {The young massive Jupiters discovered with high-contrast imaging1–4 provide a unique opportunity to study the formation and early evolution of gas giant planets. A key question is to what extent gravitational energy from accreted gas contributes to the internal energy of a newly formed planet. This has led to a range of formation scenarios from ‘cold’ to ‘hot’ start models5–8. For a planet of a given mass, these initial conditions govern its subsequent evolution in luminosity and radius. Except for upper limits from radial velocity studies9,10, disk modelling11 and dynamical instability arguments12, no mass measurements of young planets are yet available to distinguish between these different models. Here, we report on the detection of the astrometric motion of Beta Pictoris, the {\textasciitilde}21-Myr-old host star of an archetypical directly imaged gas giant planet, around the system’s centre of mass. Subtracting the highly accurate Hipparcos13,14 and Gaia15,16 proper motion from the internal 3 yr Hipparcos astrometric data reveals the reflex motion of the star, giving a model-independent planet mass of 11 ± 2 Jupiter masses. This is consistent with scenarios in which the planet is formed in a high-entropy state as assumed by hot start models. The ongoing data collection by Gaia will soon lead to mass measurements of other young gas giants and form a great asset to further constrain early-evolution scenarios.},

The atmospheres of these planets likely contain minor condensates and hazes, which at normal viewing geometry have negligible optical depth, but at slant viewing geometry have appreciable optical depth that can obscure absorption features of gaseous atmospheric species. We identify several possible condensates. We predict that this is a general masking mechanism for all planets, not just for HD 209458b, and will lead to weaker than expected or undetected absorption features.

In this study, we identify what can unambiguously be determined about the atmospheres of exoplanets from their transmission spectra by applying the retrieval method to synthetic observations of the super-Earth GJ 1214b. Our approach to inferring constraints on atmospheric parameters is to compute their joint and marginal posterior probability distributions using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique in a parallel tempering scheme. A new atmospheric parameterization is introduced that is applicable to general atmospheres in which the main constituent is not known a priori and clouds may be present. Our main finding is that a unique constraint of the mixing ratios of the absorbers and two spectrally inactive gases (such as N2 and primordial H2+ He) is possible if the observations are sufficient to quantify both (1) the broadband transit depths in at least one absorption feature for each absorber and (2) the slope and strength of the molecular Rayleigh scattering signature. A second finding is that the surface pressure or cloud-top pressure can be quantified if a surface or cloud deck is present at low optical depth. A third finding is that the mean molecular mass can be constrained by measuring either the Rayleigh scattering slope or the shapes of the absorption features, thus enabling one to distinguish between cloudy hydrogen-rich atmospheres and high mean molecular mass atmospheres. We conclude, however, that without the signature of molecular Rayleigh scattering—even with robustly detected infrared absorption features ({\textgreater}10σ)—there is no reliable way to tell from the transmission spectrum whether the absorber is a main constituent of the atmosphere or just a minor species with a mixing ratio of X abs {\textless} 0.1\%. The retrieval method leads us to a conceptual picture of which details in transmission spectra are essential for unique characterizations of well-mixed exoplanet atmospheres.},

We present representative transit spectra for a range of classes of atmosphere models for GJ 1214b.

A dense atmosphere rules out bulk compositions for GJ1214b that explain its large radius by the presence of a very low density gas layer surrounding the planet. High-altitude clouds can alternatively explain the flat transmission spectrum, but they would need to be optically thick up to 10 mbar or consist of particles with a range of sizes approaching 1 μm in diameter.},

	abstract = {Recent observations of the super-Earth GJ 1214b show that it has a 
relatively featureless transmission spectrum. One suggestion is that
these observations indicate that the planet's atmosphere is vertically
compact, perhaps due to a water-rich composition that yields a large
mean molecular weight. Another suggestion is that the atmosphere is
hydrogen/helium-rich with clouds that obscure predicted absorption
features. Previous models that incorporate clouds have included their
effect without a strong physical motivation for their existence. Here,
we present model atmospheres of GJ 1214b that include physically
motivated clouds of two types. We model the clouds that are present in
chemical equilibrium, as has been suggested to occur on brown dwarfs,
which include KCl and ZnS for this planet. We also include clouds that
form as a result of photochemistry, forming a hydrocarbon haze layer. We
use a photochemical kinetics model to understand the vertical
distribution and available mass of haze-forming molecules. We model both
solar and enhanced-metallicity cloudy models and determine the cloud
properties necessary to match observations. In enhanced-metallicity
atmospheres, we find that the equilibrium clouds can match the
observations of GJ 1214b if they are lofted high into the atmosphere and
have a low sedimentation efficiency (f sed = 0.1). We find
that models with a variety of hydrocarbon haze properties can match the
observations. Particle sizes from 0.01 to 0.25 μm can match the
transmission spectrum with haze-forming efficiencies as low as 1\%-5\%.},

	abstract = {Exoplanetary transmission spectroscopy in the near-infrared using the 
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) NICMOS is currently ambiguous because
different observational groups claim different results from the same
data, depending on their analysis methodologies. Spatial scanning with
HST/WFC3 provides an opportunity to resolve this ambiguity. We here
report WFC3 spectroscopy of the giant planets HD 209458b and XO-1b in
transit, using spatial scanning mode for maximum photon-collecting
efficiency. We introduce an analysis technique that derives the
exoplanetary transmission spectrum without the necessity of explicitly
decorrelating instrumental effects, and achieves nearly photon-limited
precision even at the high flux levels collected in spatial scan mode.
Our errors are within 6\% (XO-1) and 26\% (HD 209458b) of the photon-limit
at a resolving power of λ/δλ {\textasciitilde} 70, and are better
than 0.01\% per spectral channel. Both planets exhibit water absorption
of approximately 200 ppm at the water peak near 1.38 μm. Our result
for XO-1b contradicts the much larger absorption derived from NICMOS
spectroscopy. The weak water absorption we measure for HD 209458b is
reminiscent of the weakness of sodium absorption in the first
transmission spectroscopy of an exoplanet atmosphere by Charbonneau et
al. Model atmospheres having uniformly distributed extra opacity of
0.012 cm2 g-1 account approximately for both
our water measurement and the sodium absorption. Our results for HD
209458b support the picture advocated by Pont et al. in which weak
molecular absorptions are superposed on a transmission spectrum that is
dominated by continuous opacity due to haze and/or dust. However, the
extra opacity needed for HD 209458b is grayer than for HD 189733b, with
a weaker Rayleigh component.},

Numerous studies have investigated to what extent the presence of a stellar companion can affect the planet-formation process. Such studies have implications that can reach beyond the sole context of binaries, as they allow to test certain aspects of the planet-formation scenario by submitting them to extreme environments. We review here the current understanding on this complex problem. We show in particular how each of the different stages of the planet-formation process is affected differently by binary perturbations. We focus especially on the intermediate stage of kilometre-sized planetesimal accretion, which has proven to be the most sensitive to binarity and for which the presence of some exoplanets observed in tight binaries is difficult to explain by in situ formation following the “standard” planet-formation scenario. Some tentative solutions to this apparent paradox are presented. The last part of our review presents a thorough description of the problem of planet habitability, for which the binary environment creates a complex situation because of the presence of two irradiation sources of varying distance.},

	abstract = {Efficient lunar resource utilization requires accurate and quantitative evaluation of mineral and glass abundances, distribution, and extraction feasibility, especially for ilmenite (TiO2). The modal analyses have performed on lunar basaltic terrains using hyperspectral remote sensing data along with ground truth chemistry and mineralogy. The main aim of the present work is to characterize the lunar Mare Orientale basalts based on TiO2 content and quantify the lunar surface minerals, including clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, plagioclase, and olivine. The Orientale basin is one of the youngest impact multi-ringed basins on the Moon covering 930 km in diameter centered at 20°S 95°W. The morphological features in the Orientale basin have developed interest among geoscientist to explore further study on this region. Based on the Apollo orbital, geochemical, and Earth-based spectral data, it is concluded that the Orientale ejecta are uniformly feldspathic in composition, almost pure anorthosite with no evidence of ultramafic components (Hawke, Geophys Res Lett 18(11):2141–2144, 1991). Greeley et al. (Geophys Res 98:17183–17205, 1993) have conferred the Orientale basin bearing the low-Ti basalts by using Galileo images. In this study, parts of basaltic regions of Mare Orientale, Lacus Veris, and Lacus Autumni of the Orientale basin are investigated using Moon Mineralogical Mapper (M3) data of onboard Chandrayaan-1 orbiter. Lucey’s (1998) TiO2 estimation method and spectral profiles and spectral unmixing techniques have been used to detect and map the minerals, including plagioclase, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxenes, olivine, and various basalts such as low-, medium-, and high-Ti basalts. The Orientale data were acquired by M3’s reduced resolution mode with 20–40 nm spectral resolution and 140 m/pixel across the 40 km field of view. The RELAB mineral spectra of plagioclase, clino/orthopyroxenes, olivine and various basaltic spectra, chemistry and mineralogy have been employed to unmixing analysis. Comparing the spectral profiles of the basaltic regions with the RELAB basaltic spectra, the distribution and nature of TiO2 basalts in the Orientale basaltic regions have been analyzed in quantitative manner in the present research.},

It is an object-detection system, which principles consist basically in the transmission, propagation, and reflection of radio waves. After the first exploitations in the military field, radar evolved as a useful device also in the civil field, widely extending its applications. After having been tested on Earth, radar capabilities to penetrate a planet surface have been applied on Mars exploration. MARSIS, part of the payload of ESA Mars Express mission, and SHARAD, embarked on board NASA MRO spacecraft, are two nadir-looking radar sounders which use synthetic aperture radar (SAR) techniques. The two instruments are complementary: MARSIS is able to detect subsurface interfaces at great depth, while SHARAD can better discriminate subsurface interfaces close to the surface. The two radars achieved information on Martian craters, both exposed and buried, provided geophysical evidences for the former existence of an ocean in the Martian northern hemisphere, investigated Martian pedestal craters, provided a useful contribution to analyze the nature of the Medusae Fossae Formation, and probed the ice-rich polar layered deposits of Mars, detected a boundary in many areas of plains off the south polar layered deposits. The analysis of MARSIS data enables to study also the Martian ionosphere and to estimate its TEC producing the related maps. Through volumetric (3D) study, the two radars provide an opportunity to extend our knowledge of a planetary body to the third dimension, allowing to detect features that are difficult to investigate in vertical profiles. Since Martian polar terrains are considered a close analogue to the material forming the crusts of Jovian satellites Europa and Ganymede, a radar sounder, RIME, has been selected as part of ESA’s first large-class mission in Cosmic Vision Program, JUICE, the first orbiter on an icy moon which will investigate the emergence of habitable worlds around gas giants, characterizing Ganymede, Europa, and Callisto as planetary objects and potential habitats.},

However, to use the GRACE data products, de-striping/filtering is required. We applied the multichannel singular spectrum analysis (MSSA) technique to filter GRACE data and separate its principal components (PCs) at different periodicities. Data averaging over the 15 largest river basins of Russia was performed. Spring 2013 can be characterized by the extremely large snow accumulation occurred in Russia. Melting of this snow induced large floods and abrupt increase of river levels. The exceptional maxima are evident from GRACE observations, which can be compared to the hydrological models, such as Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) or WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM), and gauge data. Long-periodic climate-related changes were separated into PC 2. Finally, it was observed that there were mass increases in Siberia and decreases around the Caspian Sea. Overall trend over Russia demonstrates mass increase until 2009, when it had a maximum, followed by the decrease.},

	abstract = {To accurately predict the iron abundance of the Moon has long been the goal for lunar remote sensing studies. In this paper, we present a new iron model based on partial least squares regression (PLS) method and apply this model to map the global lunar iron distribution using Clementine ultraviolet-visible (UVVIS) dataset. Our iron model has taken into account of more calibration sites other than Apollo and Luna sample-return sites and stations (i.e., the six additional highland or immature sites) in combination with more spectral bands (5 bands and 2 band ratios), in order to derive reliable FeO content and improve the robustness of the PLS model. By comparing the PLS-derived iron map with Lucey’s band-ratio FeO map and Lawrence’s Lunar Prospector (LP) FeO map, the differences are mostly within 1 wt\% in FeO content. Moreover, PLS-derived FeO is more consistent with LP’s result which was derived by direct measurement of Fe gamma-ray line (7.6 MeV) rather than the Lucey’s experiential algorithm applying only two bands (750, 950 nm) of Clementine UVVIS dataset. With a global mode of 5.1 wt\%, PLS-derived iron map is also validated by FeO abundances of lunar feldspathic meteorites and in support of the lunar magma ocean hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Radar is the acronym for RAdio Detection And Ranging. It is an object-detection system, which principles consist basically in the transmission, propagation, and reflection of radio waves. After the first exploitations in the military field, radar evolved as a useful device also in the civil field, widely extending its applications. After having been tested on Earth, radar capabilities to penetrate a planet surface have been applied on Mars exploration. MARSIS, part of the payload of ESA Mars Express mission, and SHARAD, embarked on board NASA MRO spacecraft, are two nadir-looking radar sounders which use synthetic aperture radar (SAR) techniques. The two instruments are complementary: MARSIS is able to detect subsurface interfaces at great depth, while SHARAD can better discriminate subsurface interfaces close to the surface. The two radars achieved information on Martian craters, both exposed and buried, provided geophysical evidences for the former existence of an ocean in the Martian northern hemisphere, investigated Martian pedestal craters, provided a useful contribution to analyze the nature of the Medusae Fossae Formation, and probed the ice-rich polar layered deposits of Mars, detected a boundary in many areas of plains off the south polar layered deposits. The analysis of MARSIS data enables to study also the Martian ionosphere and to estimate its TEC producing the related maps. Through volumetric (3D) study, the two radars provide an opportunity to extend our knowledge of a planetary body to the third dimension, allowing to detect features that are difficult to investigate in vertical profiles. Since Martian polar terrains are considered a close analogue to the material forming the crusts of Jovian satellites Europa and Ganymede, a radar sounder, RIME, has been selected as part of ESA’s first large-class mission in Cosmic Vision Program, JUICE, the first orbiter on an icy moon which will investigate the emergence of habitable worlds around gas giants, characterizing Ganymede, Europa, and Callisto as planetary objects and potential habitats.},

In particular, GRACE temporal gravity field observations revolutionize the study of basin-scale hydrology, because gravity data reflect mass changes related to ground and surface water redistribution, ice melting, and precipitation accumulation over large scales. However, to use the GRACE data products, de-striping/filtering is required. We applied the multichannel singular spectrum analysis (MSSA) technique to filter GRACE data and separate its principal components (PCs) at different periodicities. Data averaging over the 15 largest river basins of Russia was performed. Spring 2013 can be characterized by the extremely large snow accumulation occurred in Russia. Melting of this snow induced large floods and abrupt increase of river levels. The exceptional maxima are evident from GRACE observations, which can be compared to the hydrological models, such as Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) or WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM), and gauge data. Long-periodic climate-related changes were separated into PC 2. Finally, it was observed that there were mass increases in Siberia and decreases around the Caspian Sea. Overall trend over Russia demonstrates mass increase until 2009, when it had a maximum, followed by the decrease.},

	abstract = {Efficient lunar resource utilization requires accurate and quantitative evaluation of mineral and glass abundances, distribution, and extraction feasibility, especially for ilmenite (TiO2). The modal analyses have performed on lunar basaltic terrains using hyperspectral remote sensing data along with ground truth chemistry and mineralogy. The main aim of the present work is to characterize the lunar Mare Orientale basalts based on TiO2 content and quantify the lunar surface minerals, including clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, plagioclase, and olivine. The Orientale basin is one of the youngest impact multi-ringed basins on the Moon covering 930 km in diameter centered at 20°S 95°W. The morphological features in the Orientale basin have developed interest among geoscientist to explore further study on this region. Based on the Apollo orbital, geochemical, and Earth-based spectral data, it is concluded that the Orientale ejecta are uniformly feldspathic in composition, almost pure anorthosite with no evidence of ultramafic components (Hawke, Geophys Res Lett 18(11):2141–2144, 1991). Greeley et al. (Geophys Res 98:17183–17205, 1993) have conferred the Orientale basin bearing the low-Ti basalts by using Galileo images. In this study, parts of basaltic regions of Mare Orientale, Lacus Veris, and Lacus Autumni of the Orientale basin are investigated using Moon Mineralogical Mapper (M3) data of onboard Chandrayaan-1 orbiter. Lucey’s (1998) TiO2 estimation method and spectral profiles and spectral unmixing techniques have been used to detect and map the minerals, including plagioclase, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxenes, olivine, and various basalts such as low-, medium-, and high-Ti basalts. The Orientale data were acquired by M3’s reduced resolution mode with 20–40 nm spectral resolution and 140 m/pixel across the 40 km field of view. The RELAB mineral spectra of plagioclase, clino/orthopyroxenes, olivine and various basaltic spectra, chemistry and mineralogy have been employed to unmixing analysis. Comparing the spectral profiles of the basaltic regions with the RELAB basaltic spectra, the distribution and nature of TiO2 basalts in the Orientale basaltic regions have been analyzed in quantitative manner in the present research.},

Numerous studies have investigated to what extent the presence of a stellar companion can affect the planet-formation process. Such studies have implications that can reach beyond the sole context of binaries, as they allow to test certain aspects of the planet-formation scenario by submitting them to extreme environments. We review here the current understanding on this complex problem. We show in particular how each of the different stages of the planet-formation process is affected differently by binary perturbations. We focus especially on the intermediate stage of kilometre-sized planetesimal accretion, which has proven to be the most sensitive to binarity and for which the presence of some exoplanets observed in tight binaries is difficult to explain by in situ formation following the “standard” planet-formation scenario. Some tentative solutions to this apparent paradox are presented. The last part of our review presents a thorough description of the problem of planet habitability, for which the binary environment creates a complex situation because of the presence of two irradiation sources of varying distance.},

	abstract = {To accurately predict the iron abundance of the Moon has long been the goal for lunar remote sensing studies. In this paper, we present a new iron model based on partial least squares regression (PLS) method and apply this model to map the global lunar iron distribution using Clementine ultraviolet-visible (UVVIS) dataset. Our iron model has taken into account of more calibration sites other than Apollo and Luna sample-return sites and stations (i.e., the six additional highland or immature sites) in combination with more spectral bands (5 bands and 2 band ratios), in order to derive reliable FeO content and improve the robustness of the PLS model. By comparing the PLS-derived iron map with Lucey’s band-ratio FeO map and Lawrence’s Lunar Prospector (LP) FeO map, the differences are mostly within 1 wt\% in FeO content. Moreover, PLS-derived FeO is more consistent with LP’s result which was derived by direct measurement of Fe gamma-ray line (7.6 MeV) rather than the Lucey’s experiential algorithm applying only two bands (750, 950 nm) of Clementine UVVIS dataset. With a global mode of 5.1 wt\%, PLS-derived iron map is also validated by FeO abundances of lunar feldspathic meteorites and in support of the lunar magma ocean hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Context. Directly imaged planets and substellar companions are key 
targets for the characterization of self-luminous atmospheres. Their
photometric appearance at 4-5 μm is sensitive to the chemical
composition and cloud content of their atmosphere. Aims: We aim
to systematically characterize the atmospheres of directly imaged
low-mass companions at 4-5 μm. We want to homogeneously process the
data, provide robust flux measurements, and compile a photometric
library at thermal wavelengths of these mostly young, low-gravity
objects. In this way, we want to find trends related to their spectral
type and surface gravity by comparing with isolated brown dwarfs and
predictions from atmospheric models. Methods: We used the
high-resolution, high-contrast capabilities of NACO at the Very Large
Telescope (VLT) to directly image the companions of HIP 65426, PZ Tel,
and HD 206893 in the NB4.05 and/or M' filters. For the same targets, and
additionally β Pic, we also analyzed six archival VLT/NACO datasets
which were taken with the NB3.74, L', NB4.05, and M' filters. The data
processing and photometric extraction of the companions was done with
PynPoint while the species toolkit was used to further analyze and
interpret the fluxes and colors. Results: We detect for the first
time HIP 65426 b, PZ Tel B, and HD 206893 B in the NB4.05 filter, PZ Tel
B and HD 206893 B in the M' filter, and β Pic b in the NB3.74
filter. We provide calibrated magnitudes and fluxes with a careful
analysis of the error budget, both for the new and archival datasets.
The L'-NB4.05 and L'-M' colors of the studied sample are all red while
the NB4.05-M' color is blue for β Pic b, gray for PZ Tel B, and red
for HIP 65426 b and HD 206893 B (although typically with low
significance). The absolute NB4.05 and M' fluxes of our sample are all
larger than those of field dwarfs with similar spectral types. Finally,
the surface gravity of β Pic b has been constrained to log g =
4.17-0.13+0.10 dex from its photometry and
dynamical mass. Conclusions: A red color at 3-4 μm and a blue
color at 4-5 μm might be (partially) caused by H2O and CO
absorption, respectively, which are expected to be the most dominant
gaseous opacities in hot (Teff ≳ 1300 K) atmospheres.
The red characteristics of β Pic b, HIP 65426 b, and HD 206893 B at
3-5μm, as well as their higher fluxes in NB4.05 and M' compared to
field dwarfs, indicate that cloud densities are enhanced close to the
photosphere as a result of their low surface gravity.

the general-purpose model atmosphere code PHOENIX (radiative transfer,
hydrostatic equilibrium, mixing-length theory, chemical equilibrium) in
order to consistently calculate cloud formation and radiative transfer
with their feedback on convection and gas-phase depletion. We calculate
the complete 1D model atmosphere structure and the chemical details of
the cloud layers. The DRIFT-PHOENIX models enable the first stellar
atmosphere simulation that is based on the actual cloud formation
process. The resulting (T, p) -profiles differ considerably from the
previous limiting PHOENIX cases DUSTY and COND. A tentative comparison
with observations demonstrates that the determination of effective
temperatures based on simple cloud models has to be applied with care.
Based on our new models, we suggest a mean Teff = 1800 K for
the L dwarf twin-binary system DENIS J0205-1159, which is up to 500 K
hotter than suggested in the literature. We show transition spectra for
gas-giant planets which form dust clouds in their atmospheres and

	abstract = {Nearly 15 yr of radial velocity (RV) monitoring and direct imaging enabled the detection of two giant planets orbiting the young, nearby star β Pictoris. The δ Scuti pulsations of the star, which overwhelm planetary signals, need to be carefully suppressed. In this work, we independently revisit the analysis of the RV data following a different approach than available in the literature to model the activity of the star. We show that a Gaussian process (GP) with a stochastically driven damped harmonic oscillator kernel can model the δ Scuti pulsations. It provides similar results to parametric models but with a simpler framework, using only three hyperparameters. It also enables us to model poorly sampled RV data that were excluded from previous analyses, hence extending the RV baseline by nearly five years. Altogether, the orbit and mass of both planets can be constrained from RV only, which was not possible with the parametric modeling. To characterize the system more accurately, we also perform a joint fit of all available relative astrometry and RV data. Our orbital solutions for b favor a low eccentricity of and a relatively short period of yr. The orbit of c is eccentric with with a period of 3.36 ± 0.03 yr. We find model-independent masses of 11.7 ± 1.4 and 8.5 ± 0.5 for b and c, respectively, assuming coplanarity. The mass of b is consistent with the hottest start evolutionary models, at an age of 25 ± 3 Myr. A direct detection of c would provide a second calibration measurement in a coeval system.},

The β Pictoris disk is presented to Earth almost edgeon and is composed of solid particles in nearly coplanar orbits. The observed change in surface brightness with distance from the star implies that the mass density of the disk falls off with approximately the third power of the radius. Because the circumstellar material is in the form of a highly flattened disk rather than a spherical shell, it is presumed to be associated with planet formation.

accreting onto a planet is processed through an accretion shock. In this
series of papers we study this shock because it is key in setting the
structure of the forming planet and thus its postformation luminosity,
with dramatic observational consequences. We perform one-dimensional
gray radiation-hydrodynamical simulations with nonequilibrium
(two-temperature) radiation transport and up-to-date opacities. We
survey the parameter space of accretion rate, planet mass, and planet
radius and obtain postshock temperatures, pressures, and entropies, as
well as global radiation efficiencies. We find that the shock
temperature Tshock is usually given by the "free-streaming"
limit. At low temperatures the dust opacity can make the shock hotter
but not significantly so. We corroborate this with an original
semianalytical derivation of Tshock. We also estimate the change
in luminosity between the shock and the nebula. Neither Tshock
nor the luminosity profile depend directly on the optical depth between
the shock and the nebula. Rather, Tshock depends on the immediate
preshock opacity, and the luminosity change on the equation of state. We find
quite high immediate postshock entropies (S≈ 13-20 kB
mH-1), which makes it seem unlikely that the shock
can cool the planet. The global radiation efficiencies are high
(ηphys≳ 97\%), but the remainder of the total incoming
energy, which is brought into the planet, exceeds the internal luminosity
of classical cold starts by orders of magnitude. Overall, these findings
suggest that warm or hot starts are more plausible.},

has long been considered to be the energetics of the accretion shock at
the surface of the planet. We use one-dimensional
radiation-hydrodynamical simulations to study the radiative loss
efficiency and to obtain postshock temperatures and pressures and thus
entropies. The efficiency is defined as the fraction of the total
incoming energy flux that escapes the system (roughly the Hill sphere),
taking into account the energy recycling that occurs ahead of the shock
in a radiative precursor. We focus in this paper on a constant equation
of state (EOS) to isolate the shock physics but use constant and
tabulated opacities. While robust quantitative results will have to
await a self-consistent treatment including hydrogen dissociation and
ionization, the results presented here show the correct qualitative
behavior and can be understood from semianalytical calculations. The
shock is found to be isothermal and supercritical for a range of
conditions relevant to the core accretion formation scenario (CA), with
Mach numbers Ma ≳ 3. Across the shock, the entropy decreases
significantly by a few times kB/baryon. While
nearly 100\% of the incoming kinetic energy is converted to radiation
locally, the efficiencies are found to be as low as roughly 40\%,
implying that a significant fraction of the total accretion energy is
brought into the planet. However, for realistic parameter combinations
in the CA scenario, we find that a nonzero fraction of the luminosity
always escapes the Hill sphere. This luminosity could explain, at least
in part, recent observations in the young LkCa 15 and HD 100546 systems.},

	abstract = {Traditional thermal evolution models of giant planets employ arbitrary initial conditions selected more for computational expediency than physical accuracy. Since the initial conditions are eventually forgotten by the evolving planet, this approach is valid for mature planets, if not young ones. To explore the evolution at young ages of jovian mass planets, we have employed model planets created by one implementation of the core-accretion mechanism as initial conditions for evolutionary calculations. The luminosities and early cooling rates of young planets are highly sensitive to their internal entropies, which depend on the formation mechanism and are highly model dependent. As a result of the accretion shock through which most of the planetary mass is processed, we find lower initial internal entropies than commonly assumed in published evolution tracks. Consequently, young Jovian planets are smaller, cooler, and several to 100 times less luminous than predicted by earlier models. Furthermore, the time interval during which the young Jupiters are fainter than expected depends on the mass of planet. Jupiter mass planets (1MJ) align with the conventional model luminosity in as little at 20 million years, but 10MJ planets can take up to 1 billion years to match commonly cited luminosities, given our implementation of the core-accretion mechanism. If our assumptions, especially including our treatment of the accretion shock, are correct and if extrasolar Jovian planets indeed form with low entropy, then young Jovian planets are substantially fainter at young ages than currently believed. Furthermore, early evolution tracks should be regarded as uncertain for much longer than the commonly quoted 106 yr. These results have important consequences both for detection strategies and for assigning masses to young Jovian planets based on observed luminosities.},

	abstract = {New numerical simulations of the formation of the giant planets are presented, in which for the first time both the gas and planetesimal accretion rates are calculated in a self-consistent, interactive fashion. The simulations combine three elements: (1) three-body accretion cross sections of solids onto an isolated planetary embryo, (2) a stellar evolution code for the planet's gaseous envelope, and (3) a planetesimal dissolution code within the envelope, used to evaluate the planet's effective capture radius and the energy deposition profile of accreted material. Major assumptions include: The planet is embedded in a disk of gas and small planetesimals with locally uniform initial surface mass density, and planetesimals are not allowed to migrate into or out of the planet's feeding zone. All simulations are characterized by three major phases. During the first phase, the planet's mass consists primarily of solid material. The planetesimal accretion rate, which dominates that of gas, rapidly increases owing to runaway accretion, then decreases as the planet's feeding zone is depleted. During the second phase, both solid and gas accretion rates are small and nearly independent of time. The third phase, marked by runaway gas accretion, starts when the solid and gas masses are about equal. It is engendered by a strong positive feedback on the gas accretion rates, driven by the rapid contraction of the gaseous envelope and the rapid expansion of the outer boundary, which depends on the planet's total mass. The overall evolutionary time scale is generally determined by the length of the second phase. The actual rates at which the giant planets accreted small planetesimals is probably intermediate between the constant rates assumed in most previous studies and the highly variable rates used here. Within the context of the adopted model of planetesimal accretion, the joint constraints of the time scale for dissipation of the solar nebula and the current high-Zmasses of the giant planets lead to estimates of the initial surface density (σinit) of planetesimals in the outer region of the solar nebula. The results show that σinit≈ 10 g cm−2near Jupiter's orbit and that σinit∝a−2, whereais the distance from the Sun. These values are a factor of 3 to 4 times as high as that of the “minimum-mass” solar nebula at Jupiter's distance and a factor of 2 to 3 times as high at Saturn's distance. The estimates for the formation time of Jupiter and Saturn are 1 to 10 million years, whereas those for Uranus fall in the range 2 to 16 million years. These estimates follow from the properties of our Solar System and do not necessarily apply to giant planets in other planetary systems.},

	abstract = {Context. Methods used to detect giant exoplanets can be broadly divided into two categories: indirect and direct. Indirect methods are more sensitive to planets with a small orbital period, whereas direct detection is more sensitive to planets orbiting at a large distance from their host star. This dichotomy makes it difficult to combine the two techniques on a single target at once. Aims: Simultaneous measurements made by direct and indirect techniques offer the
possibility of determining the mass and luminosity of planets and a method of testing formation models. Here, we aim to show how
long-baseline interferometric observations guided by radial-velocity can be used in such a way. Methods: We observed the
recently-discovered giant planet β Pictoris c with GRAVITY, mounted on the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. Results: This study constitutes the first direct confirmation of a planet discovered through radial velocity. We find that the planet has a temperature of T = 1250 ± 50 K and a dynamical mass of M = 8.2 ± 0.8
MJup. At 18.5 ± 2.5 Myr, this puts β Pic c close
to a `hot start' track, which is usually associated with formation via disk instability. Conversely, the planet orbits at a distance of 2.7 au, which is too close for disk instability to occur. The low apparent magnitude (MK = 14.3 ± 0.1) favours a core accretion
scenario. Conclusions: We suggest that this apparent
contradiction is a sign of hot core accretion, for example, due to the mass of the planetary core or the existence of a high-temperature accretion shock during formation.},

	abstract = {Context. The nearby and young β Pictoris system hosts a well 
resolved disk, a directly imaged massive giant planet orbiting at
≃9 au, as well as an inner planet orbiting at ≃2.7 au, which
was recently detected through radial velocity (RV). As such, it offers
several unique opportunities for detailed studies of planetary system
formation and early evolution. Aims: We aim to further constrain
the orbital and physical properties of β Pictoris b and c using a
combination of high contrast imaging, long base-line interferometry, and
RV data. We also predict the closest approaches or the transit times of
both planets, and we constrain the presence of additional planets in the
system. Methods: We obtained six additional epochs of SPHERE
data, six additional epochs of GRAVITY data, and five additional epochs
of RV data. We combined these various types of data in a single
Markov-chain Monte Carlo analysis to constrain the orbital parameters
and masses of the two planets simultaneously. The analysis takes into
account the gravitational influence of both planets on the star and
hence their relative astrometry. Secondly, we used the RV and high
contrast imaging data to derive the probabilities of presence of
additional planets throughout the disk, and we tested the impact of
absolute astrometry. Results: The orbital properties of both
planets are constrained with a semi-major axis of 9.8 ± 0.4 au
and 2.7 ± 0.02 au for b and c, respectively, and eccentricities
of 0.09 ± 0.1 and 0.27 ± 0.07, assuming the HIPPARCOS
distance. We note that despite these low fitting error bars, the
eccentricity of β Pictoris c might still be over-estimated. If no
prior is provided on the mass of β Pictoris b, we obtain a very low
value that is inconsistent with what is derived from brightness-mass
models. When we set an evolutionary model motivated prior to the mass of
β Pictoris b, we find a solution in the 10-11 MJup
range. Conversely, β Pictoris c's mass is well constrained, at 7.8
± 0.4 MJup, assuming both planets are on coplanar
orbits. These values depend on the assumptions on the distance of the
β Pictoris system. The absolute astrometry HIPPARCOS-Gaia data are
consistent with the solutions presented here at the 2σ level, but
these solutions are fully driven by the relative astrometry plus RV
data. Finally, we derive unprecedented limits on the presence of
additional planets in the disk. We can now exclude the presence of
planets that are more massive than about 2.5 MJup closer than
3 au, and more massive than 3.5 MJup between 3 and 7.5 au.
Beyond 7.5 au, we exclude the presence of planets that are more massive
than 1-2 MJup. Conclusions: Combining relative
astrometry and RVs allows one to precisely constrain the orbital
parameters of both planets and to give lower limits to potential
additional planets throughout the disk. The mass of β Pictoris c is
also well constrained, while additional RV data with appropriate
observing strategies are required to properly constrain the mass of
β Pictoris b.},

	abstract = {Clouds and hazes have plagued the interpretation of exoplanet transmission and emission spectra and phase curves since the beginnings of exoplanet atmospheric investigations, and thus understanding the impact of these aerosols on observations is vital for revealing atmospheric composition, thermal structure, and dynamics. Aerosols in exoplanet atmospheres are difficult to characterize due to several major uncertainties, including their composition, formation pathway, and spatial and size distribution. While simplified aerosol models can be used to obtain relatively good fits to data, many of these properties are either ignored or treated as free parameters such that the results lack physical insights. In the last several years we have developed an aerosol microphysics model for exoplanets in response to this problem that calculates rates of aerosol nucleation, condensation, evaporation, coagulation, and transport, such that the spatial and size distribution of exoplanet aerosols can be computed from first principles given compositions predicted from equilibrium condensation models and assumed formation pathways. In this talk, I will describe our major results, including (1) successfully fitting the cloudiness of hot and warm Jupiters across a wide swath of temperatures and gravities, showing that silicate clouds and photochemical hazes dominate the aerosol opacity of these worlds, (2) predictions of which planets should exhibit the largest amplitude silicate feature at 10 microns, a key test of exoplanet aerosol composition, (3) revealing how high temperature clouds vary with longitude and latitude, and (4) how photochemical hazes impact observations of the radii and transmission spectra of mini-Neptunes. I will also describe the laboratory studies and observational tests that will be necessary in the next decade to better characterize exoplanet aerosols and improve interpretations of exoplanet atmospheric observations.},

These aerosols strongly impact observations of transmitted, reflected, and emitted light from exoplanets, obfuscating our understanding of exoplanet thermal structure and composition. Knowing the dominant aerosol composition would facilitate interpretations of exoplanet observations and theoretical understanding of their atmospheres. A variety of compositions have been proposed, including metal oxides and sulphides, iron, chromium, sulphur, and hydrocarbons. However, the relative contributions of these species to exoplanet aerosol opacity is unknown. Here we show that the aerosol composition of giant exoplanets observed in transmission is dominated by silicates and hydrocarbons. By constraining an aerosol microphysics model with trends in giant exoplanet transmission spectra, we find that silicates dominate aerosol opacity above planetary equilibrium temperatures of 950 K due to low nucleation energy barriers and high elemental abundances, while hydrocarbon aerosols dominate below 950 K due to an increase in methane abundance. Our results are robust to variations in planet gravity and atmospheric metallicity within the range of most giant transiting exoplanets. We predict that spectral signatures of condensed silicates in the mid-infrared are most prominent for hot ({\textgreater}1600 K), low-gravity ({\textless}10 m s\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$) objects.},

We distinguish and compare the extent of the various atmospheric compartments that form the atmospheric column, from the troposphere up to the thermosphere. The temperature structure is then presented, and the main causes known for explaining its variations on each body are listed. The specific roles of waves, radiation, as well as convection in shaping temperature profiles are then discussed. In a second part, the particulate components of these atmospheres, clouds and aerosols, are described in terms of their physical properties (composition, optical properties) and of their variability in both space and time. Mars , Venus, and Titan exhibit a remarkable variety of clouds and aerosols. Our knowledge about them has made considerable progress thanks to the success of space missions during the last two decades, while in parallel theoretical models have improved to the point that three-dimensional Global Climate Models now include the detailed physics of clouds and aerosols. As a result, it is now widely recognized that particulates play a key role in forcing the climate and the evolution of these bodies.},

In this review we aim to provide an introduction to the role and properties of clouds in exoplanetary atmospheres. We consider the role clouds play in influencing the spectra of planets as well as their habitability and detectability. We briefly summarize how clouds are treated in terrestrial climate models and consider the far simpler approaches that have been taken so far to model exoplanet clouds, the evidence for which we also review. Since clouds play a major role in the atmospheres of certain classes of brown dwarfs we briefly discuss brown dwarf cloud modeling as well. We also review how the scattering and extinction efficiencies of cloud particles may be approximated in certain limiting cases of small and large particles in order to facilitate physical understanding. Since clouds play such important roles in planetary atmospheres, cloud modeling may well prove to be the limiting factor in our ability to interpret future observations of extrasolar planets.},

	abstract = {Condensation clouds in substellar atmospheres have been widely inferred from spectra and photometric variability. Up until now, their horizontally averaged vertical distribution and mean particle size have been largely characterized using models, one of which is the eddy diffusion–sedimentation model from Ackerman and Marley that relies on a sedimentation efficiency parameter, f sed, to determine the vertical extent of clouds in the atmosphere. However, the physical processes controlling the vertical structure of clouds in substellar atmospheres are not well understood. In this work, we derive trends in f sed across a large range of eddy diffusivities (K zz ), gravities, material properties, and cloud formation pathways by fitting cloud distributions calculated by a more detailed cloud microphysics model. We find that f sed is dependent on K zz , but not gravity, when K zz is held constant. f sed is most sensitive to the nucleation rate of cloud particles, as determined by material properties like surface energy and molecular weight. High surface energy materials form fewer, larger cloud particles, leading to large f sed ({\textgreater}1), and vice versa for materials with low surface energy. For cloud formation via heterogeneous nucleation, f sed is sensitive to the condensation nuclei flux and radius, connecting cloud formation in substellar atmospheres to the objects’ formation environments and other atmospheric aerosols. These insights could lead to improved cloud models that help us better understand substellar atmospheres. For example, we demonstrate that f sed could increase with increasing cloud base depth in an atmosphere, shedding light on the nature of the brown dwarf L/T transition.},

	abstract = {The formation of clouds affects brown dwarf and planetary atmospheres of nearly all effective temperatures. Iron and silicate condense in L dwarf atmospheres and dissipate at the L/T transition. Minor species such as sulfides and salts condense in mid- to late T dwarfs. For brown dwarfs below T eff ∼ 450 K, water condenses in the upper atmosphere to form ice clouds. Currently, over a dozen objects in this temperature range have been discovered, and few previous theoretical studies have addressed the effect of water clouds on brown dwarf or exoplanetary spectra. Here we present a new grid of models that include the effect of water cloud opacity. We find that they become optically thick in objects below T eff ∼ 350-375 K. Unlike refractory cloud materials, water-ice particles are significantly nongray absorbers; they predominantly scatter at optical wavelengths through the J band and absorb in the infrared with prominent features, the strongest of which is at 2.8 μm. H2O, NH3, CH4, and H2 CIA are dominant opacity sources; less abundant species may also be detectable, including the alkalis, H2S, and PH3. PH3, which has been detected in Jupiter, is expected to have a strong signature in the mid-infrared at 4.3 μm in Y dwarfs around T eff = 450 K; if disequilibrium chemistry increases the abundance of PH3, it may be detectable over a wider effective temperature range than models predict. We show results incorporating disequilibrium nitrogen and carbon chemistry and predict signatures of low gravity in planetary mass objects. Finally, we make predictions for the observability of Y dwarfs and planets with existing and future instruments, including the James Webb Space Telescope and Gemini Planet Imager.},

In this review we discuss the age challenge for young stars, specifically those less than {\textasciitilde}100 m.y. old. Most age determination methods that we discuss are primarily applicable to groups of stars but can be used to estimate the age of individual objects. A reliable age scale is established above 20 m.y. from
measurement of the lithium depletion boundary (LDB) in young clusters, and consistency is shown between these ages and those from the
upper-main-sequence (UMS) and main-sequence (MS) turn-off — if
modest core convection and rotation is included in the models of higher-mass stars. Other available methods for age estimation include the kinematics of young groups, placing stars in Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams (HRDs), pulsations and seismology, surface gravity measurement, rotation and activity, and Li abundance. We review each of these methods and present known strengths and weaknesses. Below {\textasciitilde}20 m.y., both model-dependent and observational uncertainties grow, the situation is confused by the possibility of age spreads, and no reliable absolute ages yet exist. The lack of absolute age calibration below 20 m.y. should be born in mind when considering the lifetimes of protostellar phases and circumstellar material.},

Considering solar-mass primaries having the mean jitter-activity level, when they are younger than 100 / 300 / 1000 Myr, the stochastic jitter component in radial velocity measurements restricts detectable companion masses to {\textgreater} 0.3 / 0.2 / 0.1 M\_Jupiter. These numbers require a large number -- several tens -- of radial velocity observations taken over a time frame longer than the orbital period. Lower companion mass limits can be achieved for stars with less than the mean jitter and/or with an increased number of observations.},

The last two decades of exoplanet discoveries have revealed that exoplanets are very common and extremely diverse in their orbital and bulk properties. We now enter a new era as we begin to investigate the chemical diversity of exoplanets, their atmospheric and interior processes, and their formation conditions. Recent developments in the field have led to unprecedented advancements in our understanding of atmospheric chemistry of exoplanets and the implications for their formation conditions. We review these developments in the present work. We review in detail the theory of atmospheric chemistry in all classes of exoplanets discovered to date, from highly irradiated gas giants, ice giants, and super-Earths, to directly imaged giant planets at large orbital separations. We then review the observational detections of chemical species in exoplanetary atmospheres of these various types using different methods, including transit spectroscopy, Doppler spectroscopy, and direct imaging. In addition to chemical detections, we discuss the advances in determining chemical abundances in these atmospheres and how such abundances are being used to constrain exoplanetary formation conditions and migration mechanisms. Finally, we review recent theoretical work on the atmospheres of habitable exoplanets, followed by a discussion of future outlook of the field.},

	abstract = {Models of planet formation are built on underlying physical processes. In order to make sense of the origin of the planets we must first understand the origin of their building blocks. This review comes in two parts. The first part presents a detailed description of six key mechanisms of planet formation: 1) The structure and evolution of protoplanetary disks 2) The formation of planetesimals 3) Accretion of protoplanets 4) Orbital migration of growing planets 5) Gas accretion and giant planet migration 6) Resonance trapping during planet migration. While this is not a comprehensive list, it includes processes for which our understanding has changed in recent years or for which key uncertainties remain. The second part of this review shows how global models are built out of planet formation processes. We present global models to explain different populations of known planetary systems, including close-in small/low-mass planets (i.e., super-Earths), giant exoplanets, and the Solar System's planets. We discuss the different sources of water on rocky exoplanets, and use cosmochemical measurements to constrain the origin of Earth's water. We point out the successes and failings of different models and how they may be falsified. Finally, we lay out a path for the future trajectory of planet formation studies.},

Participating teams were provided the same likelihood function and set of priors to use in their analysis. They applied a variety of methods to estimate Z, the marginal likelihood for each n-planet model, including cross-validation, the Laplace approximation, importance sampling, and nested sampling. We found the dispersion in Z across different methods grew with increasing n-planet models: {\textasciitilde}3 for 0-planets, {\textasciitilde}10 for 1-planet, {\textasciitilde}100-1000 for 2-planets, and {\textgreater}10,000 for 3-planets. Most internal estimates of uncertainty in Z for individual methods significantly underestimated the observed dispersion across all methods. Methods that adopted a Monte Carlo approach by comparing estimates from multiple runs yielded plausible uncertainties. Finally, two classes of numerical algorithms (those based on importance and nested samplers) arrived at similar conclusions regarding the ratio of Zs for n and (n+1)-planet models. One analytic method (the Laplace approximation) demonstrated comparable performance. We express both optimism and caution: we demonstrate that it is practical to perform rigorous Bayesian model comparison for {\textless}=3-planet models, yet robust planet discoveries require researchers to better understand the uncertainty in Z and its connections to model selection.},

	abstract = {When fitting transiting exoplanet lightcurves, it is usually desirable to have ranges and/or priors for the parameters which are to be retrieved that include our degree of knowledge (or ignorance) in the routines which are being used. In Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routines, for example, these enter as prior distributions. These can either represent our current knowledge of the distribution of such parameters (e.g., based on their observed values) or physically plausible parameters ranges to be sampled. Among the parameters that are constrained by transiting exoplanet lightcurves, there are two which are of much physical significance: the impact parameter of the orbit, \$b = (a/R\_*){\textbackslash}cos i \$, and the planet-to-star radius ratio, \$p = R\_p/R\_s\$ (which defines the transit depth, \${\textbackslash}delta = p{\textasciicircum}2\$). These two are natural parameters to extract and constrain as they usually have well defined limits. A common set of "uninformative" priors used for those two parameters are uniform priors. However, this poses a sampling problem especially important for grazing orbits: given that we sample a value \$p\_i\$ from the prior on \$p\$, the only physically plausible values for \$b\$ to be sampled given \$p\_i\$ are those that satisfy \$b {\textless} 1 + p\_i\$. If we simply reject the sample if the sampled value of b is greater than \$1 + p\_i\$, then we will reject points from a significant portion of the prior area depending on its size. It is desirable, thus, to have an algorithm that efficiently samples values from the physically plausible zone in the \$(b,p)\$ plane. Here we present such an algorithm.},

In addition, juliet allows to fit transiting and non-transiting multi-planetary systems, and to fit GPs which might share hyperparameters between the photometry and radial-velocities simultaneously (e.g., stellar rotation periods), which might be useful for disentangling stellar activity in radial-velocity measurements. Nested Sampling, Importance Nested Sampling and Dynamic Nested Sampling is performed with publicly available codes which in turn give juliet multi-threading options, allowing it to scale the computing time of complicated multi-dimensional problems.

It is however not always clear whether the eccentricity fitted on radial velocity data is real or if it is an artefact of an inappropriate modelling. In this work, we address this question in two steps: we first assume that the model used for inference is correct and present interesting features of classical estimators. Secondly, we study whether the eccentricity estimates are to be trusted when the data contain incorrectly modelled signals, such as missed planetary companions, non Gaussian noises, correlated noises with unknown covariance, etc. Our main conclusion is that data analysis via posterior distributions, with a model including a free error term gives reliable results provided two conditions. First, convergence of the numerical methods needs to be ascertained. Secondly, the noise power spectrum should not have a particularly strong peak at the semi period of the planet of interest. As a consequence, it is difficult to determine if the signal of an apparently eccentric planet might be due to another inner companion in 2:1 mean motion resonance. We study the use of Bayes factors to disentangle these cases. Finally, we suggest methods to check if there are hints of an incorrect model in the residuals. We show on simulated data the performance of our methods and comment on the eccentricities of Proxima b and 55 Cnc f.},

Our survey is sensitive to Jupiter-mass planets out to 20 au for a majority of stars in our sample, and we report the discovery of eight new long-period planets, in addition to 20 systems with statistically significant RV trends that indicate the presence of an outer companion beyond 5 au. We combine our RV observations with AO imaging to determine the range of allowed masses and orbital separations for these companions, and account for variations in our sensitivity to companions among stars in our sample. We estimate the total occurrence rate of companions in our sample to be 52 ± 5\% over the range 1–20 MJup and 5–20 au. Our data also suggest a declining frequency for gas giant planets in these systems beyond 3–10 au, in contrast to earlier studies that found a rising frequency for giant planets in the range 0.01–3 au. This suggests either that the frequency of gas giant planets peaks between 3 and 10 au, or that outer companions in these systems have a different semi-major axis distribution than the overall population of gas giant planets. Our results also suggest that hot gas giants may be more likely to have an outer companion than cold gas giants. We find that planets with an outer companion have higher average eccentricities than their single counterparts, suggesting that dynamical interactions between planets may play an important role in these systems.},

	abstract = {Doppler spectroscopy is a powerful tool for discovering and characterizing exoplanets. For decades, the standard approach to extracting radial velocities (RVs) has been to cross-correlate observed spectra with a weighted template mask. While still widely used, this approach is known to suffer numerous drawbacks, and so in recent years increasing attention has been paid to developing new and improved ways of extracting RVs. In this proof-of-concept paper we present a simple yet powerful approach to RV extraction. We use Gaussian processes to model and align all pairs of spectra with each other; without constructing a template, we combine pairwise RV shifts to produce accurate differential stellar RVs. Doing this on a highly-localized basis enables a data-driven approach to identifying and mitigating spectral contamination, even without the input of any prior astrophysical knowledge. We show that a crude implementation of this method applied to an inactive standard star yields RVs with comparable precision to and significantly lower rms variation than RVs from industry-standard pipelines. Though amenable to numerous improvements, even in its basic form presented here our method could facilitate the study of smaller planets around a wider variety of stars than has previously been possible.},

	abstract = {Aims: Since 2011, the SOPHIE spectrograph has been used to search 
for Neptunes and super-Earths in the northern hemisphere. As part of
this observational program, 290 radial velocity measurements of the 6.4
V magnitude star HD 158259 were obtained. Additionally, TESS photometric
measurements of this target are available. We present an analysis of the
SOPHIE data and compare our results with the output of the TESS
pipeline. Methods: The radial velocity data, ancillary
spectroscopic indices, and ground-based photometric measurements were
analyzed with classical and ℓ1 periodograms. The stellar
activity was modeled as a correlated Gaussian noise and its impact on
the planet detection was measured with a new technique. Results:
The SOPHIE data support the detection of five planets, each with m sin i
≈ 6 M⊕, orbiting HD 158259 in 3.4, 5.2, 7.9, 12, and
17.4 days. Though a planetary origin is strongly favored, the 17.4 d
signal is classified as a planet candidate due to a slightly lower
statistical significance and to its proximity to the expected stellar
rotation period. The data also present low frequency variations, most
likely originating from a magnetic cycle and instrument systematics.
Furthermore, the TESS pipeline reports a significant signal at 2.17 days
corresponding to a planet of radius ≈1.2 R⊕. A
compatible signal is seen in the radial velocities, which confirms the
detection of an additional planet and yields a ≈2 M⊕
mass estimate. Conclusions: We find a system of five planets and
a strong candidate near a 3:2 mean motion resonance chain orbiting HD
158259. The planets are found to be outside of the two and three body

	abstract = {The radial velocity method is one of the most successful techniques for detecting exoplanets. It works by detecting the velocity of a host star induced by the gravitational effect of an orbiting planet, specifically the velocity along our line of sight, which is called the radial velocity of the star. As astronomical instrumentation has improved, radial velocity surveys have become sensitive to low-mass planets that cause their host star to move with radial velocities of 1 m/s or less. While analysis of a time series of stellar spectra can in theory reveal such small radial velocities, in practice intrinsic stellar variability (e.g., star spots, convective motion, pulsations) affects the spectra and often mimics a radial velocity signal. This signal contamination makes it difficult to reliably detect low mass planets and planets orbiting magnetically active stars. A principled approach to recovering planet radial velocity signals in the presence of stellar activity was proposed by Rajpaul et al. (2015) and involves the use of a multivariate Gaussian process model to jointly capture time series of the apparent radial velocity and multiple indicators of stellar activity. We build on this work in two ways: (i) we propose using dimension reduction techniques to construct more informative stellar activity indicators that make use of a larger portion of the stellar spectrum; (ii) we extend the Rajpaul et al. (2015) model to a larger class of models and use a model comparison procedure to select the best model for the particular stellar activity indicators at hand. By combining our high-information stellar activity indicators, Gaussian process models, and model selection procedure, we achieve substantially improved planet detection power compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches.},

	abstract = {Stars with spectral types earlier than about F0 on (or close) to the main sequence have long been believed to lack observable surface convection, although evolutionary models of A-type stars do predict very thin surface convective zones. We present evidence for granulation in two δ Scuti stars of spectral type A2: HD 174936 and HD 50844. Recent analyses of space-based CoRoT data revealed up to some 1000 frequencies in the photometry of these stars. The frequencies were interpreted as individual pulsation modes. If true, there must be large numbers of nonradial modes of very high degree l which should suffer cancellation effects in disk-integrated photometry (even of high space-based precision). The p-mode interpretation of all the frequencies in HD 174936 and HD 50844 depends on the assumption of white (frequency-independent) noise. Our independent analyses of the data provide an alternative explanation: most of the peaks in the Fourier spectra are the signature of non-white granulation background noise, and less than about 100 of the frequencies are actual stellar p-modes in each star. We find granulation timescales which are consistent with scaling relations that describe cooler stars with known surface convection. If the granulation interpretation is correct, the hundreds of low-amplitude Fourier peaks reported in recent studies are falsely interpreted as independent pulsation modes and a significantly lower number of frequencies are associated with pulsation, consistent with only modes of low degree.},

	abstract = {Correlated noise affects most astronomical datasets and to neglect accounting for it can lead to spurious signal detections, especially in low signal-to-noise conditions, which is often the context in which new discoveries are pursued. For instance, in the realm of exoplanet detection with radial velocity time series, stellar variability can induce false detections. However, a white noise approximation is often used because accounting for correlated noise when analyzing data implies a more complex analysis. Moreover, the computational cost can be prohibitive as it typically scales as the cube of the dataset size. For some restricted classes of correlated noise models, there are specific algorithms that can be used to help bring down the computational cost. This improvement in speed is particularly useful in the context of Gaussian process regression, however, it comes at the expense of the generality of the noise model. In this article, we present the S + LEAF noise model, which allows us to account for a large class of correlated noises with a linear scaling of the computational cost with respect to the size of the dataset. The S + LEAF model includes, in particular, mixtures of quasiperiodic kernels and calibration noise. This efficient modeling is made possible by a sparse representation of the covariance matrix of the noise and the use of dedicated algorithms for matrix inversion, solving, determinant computation, etc. We applied the S + LEAF model to reanalyze the HARPS radial velocity time series of the recently published planetary system HD 136352. We illustrate the flexibility of the S + LEAF model in handling various sources of noise. We demonstrate the importance of taking correlated noise into account, and especially calibration noise, to correctly assess the significance of detected signals.},

Here, we report the discovery of K2-132b, an inflated gas giant planet found with the NASA K2 Mission, and a revised mass for another inflated planet, K2-97b. These planets orbit on ≈9 day orbits around host stars that recently evolved into red giants. We constrain the irradiation history of these planets using models constrained by asteroseismology and Keck/High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer spectroscopy and radial velocity measurements. We measure planet radii of 1.31 ± 0.11 R J and 1.30 ± 0.07 R J, respectively. These radii are typical for planets receiving the current irradiation, but not the former, zero age main-sequence irradiation of these planets. This suggests that the current sizes of these planets are directly correlated to their current irradiation. Our precise constraints of the masses and radii of the stars and planets in these systems allow us to constrain the planetary heating efficiency of both systems as . These results are consistent with a planet re-inflation scenario, but suggest that the efficiency of planet re-inflation may be lower than previously theorized. Finally, we discuss the agreement within 10\% of the stellar masses and radii, and the planet masses, radii, and orbital periods of both systems, and speculate that this may be due to selection bias in searching for planets around evolved stars.},

In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} A summary of the contents of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 results.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The raw data collected with the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data products. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater} for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}BP{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} (330–680 nm) and {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}RP{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} (630–1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions. Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 represents a major achievement for the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia {\textless}i/{\textgreater}is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the scientific community focusses on data processing for which the international {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia {\textless}i/{\textgreater}was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia {\textless}i/{\textgreater}and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia {\textless}i/{\textgreater}data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Archive, which is available through the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia {\textless}i/{\textgreater}home page.},

	abstract = {A radial velocity (RV) survey for intermediate-mass giants has been in operation for over a decade at Okayama Astrophysical Observatory (OAO). The OAO survey has revealed that some giants show long-term linear RV accelerations (RV trends), indicating the presence of outer companions. Direct-imaging observations can help clarify what objects generate these RV trends. We present the results of high-contrast imaging observations of six intermediate-mass giants with long-term RV trends using the Subaru Telescope and HiCIAO camera. We detected co-moving companions to γ Hya B (), HD 5608 B (), and HD 109272 B (). For the remaining targets (ι Dra, 18 Del, and HD 14067), we exclude companions more massive than 30–60 M Jup at projected separations of 1″–7″. We examine whether these directly imaged companions or unidentified long-period companions can account for the RV trends observed around the six giants. We find that the Kozai mechanism can explain the high eccentricity of the inner planets ι Dra b, HD 5608 b, and HD 14067 b.},

	abstract = {We present initial results from a new high-contrast imaging program dedicated to stars that exhibit long-term Doppler radial velocity accelerations (or “trends”). The goal of the TRENDS (TaRgetting bENchmark-objects with Doppler Spectroscopy) imaging survey is to directly detect and study the companions responsible for accelerating their host star. In this first paper of the series, we report the discovery of low-mass stellar companions orbiting HD 53665, HD 68017, and HD 71881 using NIRC2 adaptive optics (AO) observations at Keck. Follow-up imaging demonstrates association through common proper motion. These comoving companions have red colors with estimated spectral types of K7-M0, M5, and M3-M4, respectively. We determine a firm lower limit to their mass from Doppler and astrometric measurements. In the near future, it will be possible to construct three-dimensional orbits and calculate the dynamical mass of HD 68017 B and possibly HD 71881 B. We already detect astrometric orbital motion of HD 68017 B, which has a projected separation of 13.0 AU. Each companion is amenable to AO-assisted direct spectroscopy. Further, each companion orbits a solar-type star, making it possible to infer metallicity and age from the primary. Such benchmark objects are essential for testing theoretical models of cool dwarf atmospheres.},

	abstract = {The disk surrounding Beta Pictoris has been imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope Planetary Camera in the four photometric filters centered near 439, 555, 675 and 814 nm, and at a total of four different spacecraft roll angles. After masking the images to exclude the disk region, a composite PSF was constructed that enabled us to generate three
statistically independent images of the disk for each filter. The images show the disk in reflected light from a radius of about 1.5 arcseconds to about 10 arcseconds. We have developed a full three dimensional simulation of the disk which reproduces the observed scattered light distribution and the known infrared photometry and direct imaging from IRAS and previous ground based investigations in a self-consistent manner. By least squares fitting all of the data we are able to derive geometric parameters of the disk and constrain the optical properties of its particles. The scattering is well described by small particles with a visible albedo of around 0.4 and a small scattering phase function variation. The inclination of the disk axis to the plane of the sky is only of order 1 degree. There is a relatively clear zone in the disk with the normal optical depth decreasing linearly within 40 AU from the star from a constant value of 0.005 between 40 and 100 AU. We find that the scale height of the disk is roughly constant within the inner 100 AU, while the outer disk has a linear scale height power law consistent with previous investigations. The disk density is not Gaussian in cross section, as might be expected for a Maxwellian distribution of similar particles, but exponential. We do not interpret this as evidence for pressure support, but rather as evidence for a particle mass spectrum. Several previously reported north-south disk asymmetries are evident in the data, but a significant new result is a rotationally symmetric warp in the inner disk. Detailed dynamical simulations based on the observed mass distribution and with an appropriate collisional viscosity show that this warp is not sustainable in the disk for more than 1 Myr, which is very small compared to the probable age of the system and its collisional timescale with other stars. We conclude that it is likely that at least one massive substellar companion in an inclined orbit to the star is responsible for maintaining the warp. This companion may also be responsible for stirring up the disk within 100 AU and
generating the clearer zone within 40 AU.},

	abstract = {We present three-dimensional models of dust distribution around β Pictoris that produce the best fits to the Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys’ images obtained by Golimowski and coworkers. We allow for the presence of either one or two separate axisymmetric dust disks. The density models are analytical, radial two power laws joined smoothly at a crossover radius with density exponentially decreasing away from the midplane of the disks. Two-disk models match the data best, yielding a reduced χ2 of ∼1.2. Our two-disk model reproduces many of the asymmetries reported in the literature and suggests that it is the secondary (tilted) disk which is largely responsible for them. Our model suggests that the secondary disk is not constrained to the inner regions of the system (extending out to at least 250 AU) and that it has a slightly larger total area of dust than the primary, as a result of slower falloff of density with radius and height. This surprising result raises many questions about the origin and dynamics of such a pair of disks. The disks overlap, but can coexist owing to their low optical depths and therefore long mean collision times. We find that the two disks have dust replenishment times on the order of 104 yr at ∼100 AU, hinting at the presence of planetesimals that are responsible for the production of second generation dust. A plausible conjecture, which needs to be confirmed by physical modeling of the collisional dynamics of bodies in the disks, is that the two observed disks are derived from underlying planetesimal disks; such disks would be anchored by the gravitational influence of planets located at less than 70 AU from β Pic that are themselves in slightly inclined orbits.},

	abstract = {Massive and water-rich planets should be ubiquitous in the universe. Many of those worlds are expected to be subject to important irradiation from their host star, and display supercritical water layers surrounded by extended steam atmospheres. Irradiated ocean planets with such inflated hydrospheres have been recently shown to be good candidates for matching the mass-radius distribution of sub-Neptunes. Here we describe a model that computes a realistic structure for water-rich planets by combining an interior model with an updated equation of state (EoS) for water, and an atmospheric model that takes into account radiative transfer. We find that the use of non appropriate EoSs can lead to the overestimation of the planetary radius by up to \${\textbackslash}sim\$10{\textbackslash}\%, depending on the planet size and composition. Our model has been applied to the GJ 9827 system as a test case and indicates Earth- or Venus-like interiors for planets b and c, respectively. Planet d could be an irradiated ocean planet with a water mass fraction of \${\textbackslash}sim\$\$20{\textbackslash}pm10{\textbackslash}\%\$. We also provide fits for the mass-radius relationships, allowing one to directly retrieve a wide range of planetary compositions, without the requirement to run the model. Our calculations finally suggest that highly irradiated planets lost their H/He content through atmospheric loss processes, and that the leftover material led to either super-Earths or sub-Neptunes, depending on the water mass fraction.},

	abstract = {Periodograms are used as a key significance assessment and visualization tool to display the significant periodicities in unevenly sampled time series. We introduce a framework of periodograms, called ‘Agatha’, to disentangle periodic signals from correlated noise and to solve the two-dimensional model selection problem: signal dimension and noise model dimension. These periodograms are calculated by applying likelihood maximization and marginalization and combined in a self-consistent way. We compare Agatha with other periodograms for the detection of Keplerian signals in synthetic radial velocity data produced for the radial velocity challenge as well as in radial velocity data sets of several Sun-like stars. In our tests, we find Agatha is able to recover signals to the adopted detection limit of the radial velocity challenge. Applied to real radial velocity, we use Agatha to confirm previous analysis of CoRoT-7 and to find two new planet candidates with minimum masses of 15.1 and 7.08 M⊕ orbiting HD177565 and HD41248, with periods of 44.5 and 13.4 d, respectively. We find that Agatha outperforms other periodograms in terms of removing correlated noise and assessing the significances of signals with more robust metrics. Moreover, it can be used to select the optimal noise model and to test the consistency of signals in time. Agatha is intended to be flexible enough to be applied to time series analyses in other astronomical and scientific disciplines. Agatha is available at agatha.herts.ac.uk.},

Different choices of noise models and statistical methods have led to much controversy in the confirmation of exoplanet candidates obtained through analysing radial velocity data. To quantify the limitation of various models and methods, we compare different noise models and signal detection criteria for various simulated and real data sets in the Bayesian framework. According to our analyses, the white noise model tend to interpret noise as signal, leading to false
positives. On the other hand, the red noise models are likely to interpret signal as noise, resulting in false negatives. We find that the Bayesian information criterion combined with a Bayes factor
threshold of 150 can efficiently rule out false positives and confirm true detections. We further propose a Goldilocks principle aimed at modelling radial velocity noise to avoid too many false positives and too many false negatives. We propose that the noise model with
RHK-dependent jitter is used in combination with the moving average model to detect planetary signals for M dwarfs. Our work may also shed light on the noise modelling for hotter stars, and provide a valid approach for finding similar principles in other disciplines.},

At a distance of 1.8 parsecs1, it is the closest single star to the Sun; only the three stars in the α Centauri system are closer. Barnard’s star is also among the least magnetically active red dwarfs known2,3 and has an estimated age older than the Solar System. Its properties make it a prime target for planetary searches; various techniques with different sensitivity limits have been used previously, including radial-velocity imaging4–6, astrometry7,8 and direct imaging9, but all ultimately led to negative or null results. Here we combine numerous measurements from high-precision radial-velocity instruments, revealing the presence of a low-amplitude periodic signal with a period of 233 days. Independent photometric and spectroscopic monitoring, as well as an analysis of instrumental systematic effects, suggest that this signal is best explained as arising from a planetary companion. The candidate planet around Barnard’s star is a cold super-Earth, with a minimum mass of 3.2 times that of Earth, orbiting near its snow line (the minimum distance from the star at which volatile compounds could condense). The combination of all radial-velocity datasets spanning 20 years of measurements additionally reveals a long-term modulation that could arise from a stellar magnetic-activity cycle or from a more distant planetary object. Because of its proximity to the Sun, the candidate planet has a maximum angular separation of 220 milliarcseconds from Barnard’s star, making it an excellent target for direct imaging and astrometric observations in the future.},

Our radial velocity (RV) time-series exhibits activity-induced fluctuations of 45 m s−1 rms, ∼3 times smaller than those measured in the optical domain, that we filter using Gaussian Process Regression. We report a 3.9σ detection of the recently discovered 8.46 -d transiting planet AU Mic b, with an estimated mass of 17.1\${\textasciicircum}\{+4.7\}\_\{-4.5\}\$ M⊕ and a bulk density of 1.3 ± 0.4 g cm−3, inducing an RV signature of semi-amplitude K = 8.5\${\textasciicircum}\{+2.3\}\_\{-2.2\}\$ m s−1 in the spectrum of its host star. A consistent detection is independently obtained when we simultaneously image stellar surface inhomogeneities and estimate the planet parameters with Zeeman–Doppler imaging (ZDI). Using ZDI, we invert the time-series of unpolarized and circularly polarized spectra into surface brightness and large-scale magnetic maps. We find a mainly poloidal and axisymmetric field of 475 G, featuring, in particular, a dipole of 450 G tilted at 19° to the rotation axis. Moreover, we detect a strong differential rotation of dΩ = 0.167 ± 0.009 rad d−1 shearing the large-scale field, about twice stronger than that shearing the brightness distribution, suggesting that both observables probe different layers of the convective zone. Even though we caution that more RV measurements are needed to accurately pin down the planet mass, AU Mic b already appears as a prime target for constraining planet formation models, studying the interactions with the surrounding debris disc, and characterizing its atmosphere with upcoming space- and ground-based missions.},

	abstract = {We present the confirmation of a new sub-Neptune close to the transition between super-Earths and sub-Neptunes transiting the M2 dwarf TOI- 269 (TIC 220479565, V = 14.4 mag, J = 10.9 mag, Rstar = 0.40 Rsun, Mstar = 0.39 Msun, d = 57 pc). The exoplanet candidate has been identified in multiple TESS sectors, and validated with high-precision spectroscopy from HARPS and ground-based photometric follow-up from ExTrA and LCO-CTIO. We determined mass, radius, and bulk density of the exoplanet by jointly modeling both photometry and radial velocities with juliet. The transiting exoplanet has an orbital period of P = 3.6977104 +- 0.0000037 days, a radius of 2.77 +- 0.12 Rearth, and a mass of 8.8 +- 1.4 Mearth. Since TOI-269 b lies among the best targets of its category for atmospheric characterization, it would be interesting to probe the atmosphere of this exoplanet with transmission spectroscopy in order to compare it to other sub-Neptunes. With an eccentricity e = 0.425+0.082-0.086, TOI-269 b has one of the highest eccentricities of the exoplanets with periods less than 10 days. The star being likely a few Gyr old, this system does not appear to be dynamically young. We surmise TOI-269 b may have acquired its high eccentricity as it migrated inward through planet-planet interactions.},

	abstract = {There have recently been detections of radio emission from low-mass stars, some of which are indicative of star-planet interactions. Motivated by these exciting new results, here we present stellar wind models for the active planet-hosting M dwarf AU Mic. Our models incorporate the large-scale photospheric magnetic field map of the star, reconstructed using the Zeeman-Doppler Imaging method. We use our models to assess if planet-induced radio emission could be generated in the corona of AU Mic, through a mechanism analogous to the sub-Alfv{\textbackslash}'enic Jupiter-Io interaction. In the case that AU Mic has a mass-loss rate of 27 times that of the Sun, we find that both planets b and c in the system can induce radio emission from 10 MHz to 3 GHz in the corona of the host star for the majority of their orbits, with peak flux densities of 10 mJy. Our predicted emission bears a striking similarity to that recently reported from GJ 1151 by Vedantham et al. (2020), which is indicative of being induced by a planet. Detection of such radio emission would allow us to place an upper limit on the mass-loss rate of the star.},

	title = {Folded transit photometry},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14233},
	abstract = {Transit photometry is perhaps the most successful method for detecting exoplanets to date. However, a substantial amount of signal processing is needed since the dip in the signal detected, an indication that there is a planet in transit, is minuscule compared to the overall background signal due mainly to its host star. In this paper, we put forth a doable and straightforward method to enhance the signal and reduce noise. We discuss how to achieve higher planetary signals by subtracting equal halves of the host star - a folded detection. This results in a light curve with a double peak-to-peak signal, 2R\_p{\textasciicircum}2/R\_s{\textasciicircum}2, compared to the usual transit. We derive an expression of the light curve and investigate the effect of two common noises: the white Gaussian background noise and the noise due to the occurrences of sunspots. We show that in both simulation and analytical expression, the folded transit reduces the effective noise by a factor of 1/sqrt(2). This reduction and the doubling of the signal enables: (1) less number of transit measurements to get a definitive transiting planet signal and (2) detection of smaller planetary radii with the usual transit with the same number of transit data. Furthermore, we show that in the presence of multiple sunspots, the estimation of planetary parameters is more accurate. While our calculations may be very simple, it covers the basic concept of planetary transits.},

	abstract = {We present the open-source Bayesian Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (BART) retrieval package, which produces estimates and uncertainties for an atmosphere's thermal profile and chemical abundances from observations. Several BART components are also stand-alone packages, including the parallel Multi-Core Markov chain Monte Carlo (MC3), which implements several Bayesian samplers; a line-by-line radiative-transfer model, transit; a code that calculates Thermochemical Equilibrium Abundances, TEA; and a test suite for verifying radiative-transfer and retrieval codes, BARTTest. The codes are in Python and C. BART and TEA are under a Reproducible Research (RR) license, which requires reviewed-paper authors to publish a compendium of all inputs, codes, and outputs supporting the paper's scientific claims. BART and TEA produce the compendium's content. Otherwise, these codes are under permissive open-source terms, as are MC3 and BARTTest, for any purpose. This paper presents an overview of the code, BARTTest, and an application to eclipse data for exoplanet HD 189733 b. Appendices address RR methodology for accelerating science, a reporting checklist for retrieval papers, the spectral resolution required for synthetic tests, and a derivation of the effective sample size required to estimate any Bayesian posterior distribution to a given precision, which determines how many iterations to run. Paper II, by Cubillos et al., presents the underlying radiative-transfer scheme and an application to transit data for exoplanet HAT-P-11b. Paper III, by Blecic et al., discusses the initialization and post-processing routines, with an application to eclipse data for exoplanet WASP-43b.

that host planetary systems: HD 1461, HD 40307, and HD 204313. The data
set spans eight years and contains more than 200 nightly averaged
velocity measurements for each star. This means that it is sensitive to
both long-period and low-mass planets and also to the effects induced by
stellar activity cycles. We modelled the data using Keplerian functions
that correspond to planetary candidates and included the short- and
long-term effects of magnetic activity. A Bayesian approach was taken
both for the data modelling, which allowed us to include information
from activity proxies such as log R'HK in the velocity
modelling, and for the model selection, which permitted determining the
number of significant signals in the system. The Bayesian model
comparison overcomes the limitations inherent to the traditional
periodogram analysis. We report an additional super-Earth planet in the
HD 1461 system. Four out of the six planets previously reported for HD
40307 are confirmed and characterised. We discuss the remaining two
proposed signals. In particular, we show that when the systematic
uncertainty associated with the techniques for estimating model
probabilities are taken into account, the current data are not
conclusive concerning the existence of the habitable-zone candidate HD
40307 g. We also fully characterise the Neptune-mass planet that orbits
HD 204313 in 34.9 days.

We propose a detection method that is calibrated by HD simulations and analyze its performances. A comparison of the theoretical results with simulations on synthetic and real data shows that the proposed method is powerful and robust.},

An important step when analyzing data from such processes is the problem of identifying the period: estimating the period of a periodic function based on noisy observations made at irregularly spaced time points. This problem is still a difficult challenge despite extensive study in different disciplines. This paper makes several contributions toward solving this problem. First, we present a nonparametric Bayesian model for period finding, based on Gaussian Processes (GPs), that does not make assumptions on the shape of the periodic function. As our experiments demonstrate, the new model leads to significantly better results in period estimation especially when the light curve does not exhibit sinusoidal shape. Second, we develop a new algorithm for parameter optimization for GP which is useful when the likelihood function is very sensitive to the parameters with numerous local minima, as in the case of period estimation. The algorithm combines gradient optimization with grid search and incorporates several mechanisms to overcome the high computational complexity of GP. Third, we develop a novel approach for using domain knowledge, in the form of a probabilistic generative model, and incorporate it into the period estimation algorithm. Experimental results validate our approach showing significant improvement over existing methods.},

	abstract = {In the pebble accretion scenario, the pebbles that form planets drift 
inward from the outer disk regions, carrying water ice with them. At the
water ice line, the water ice on the inward drifting pebbles evaporates
and is released into the gas phase, resulting in water-rich gas and dry
pebbles that move into the inner disk regions. Large planetary cores can
block the inward drifting pebbles by forming a pressure bump outside
their orbit in the protoplanetary disk. Depending on the relative
position of a growing planetary core relative to the water ice line,
water-rich pebbles might be blocked outside or inside the water ice
line. Pebbles blocked outside the water ice line do not evaporate and
thus do not release their water vapor into the gas phase, resulting in a
dry inner disk, while pebbles blocked outside the water ice line release
their water vapor into the gas phase, resulting in water vapor diffusing
into the inner disk. As a consequence, close-in sub-Neptunes that
accrete some gas from the disk should be dry or wet, respectively, if
outer gas giants are outside or inside the water ice line, assuming that
giant planets form fast, as has been suggested for Jupiter in our Solar
System. Alternatively, a sub-Neptune could form outside the water ice
line, accreting a large amount of icy pebbles and then migrating inward
as a very wet sub-Neptune. We suggest that the water content of inner
sub-Neptunes in systems with giant planets that can efficiently block
the inward drifting pebbles could constrain the formation conditions of
these systems, thus making these sub-Neptunes exciting targets for
detailed characterization (e.g., with JWST, ELT, or ARIEL). In addition,
the search for giant planets in systems with already characterized
sub-Neptunes can be used to constrain the formation conditions of giant
planets as well.},

It has the most massive circumbinary planet (1.52 Jupiter mass) with the longest orbital period (1,107.6 days) detected by the Kepler probe and is located within the habitable zone (HZ) of the system. In this work, we investigated the ability to form and house an Earth-sized planet within its HZ. First, we computed the limits of its HZ and performed numerical stability tests within that region. We found that HZ has three sub-regions that show stability, one internal, one co-orbital, and external to the host planet Kepler-1647b. Within the limits of these three regions, we performed numerical simulations of planetary formation. In the regions inner and outer to the planet, we used two different density profiles to explore different conditions of formation. In the co-orbital region, we used eight different values of total disc mass. We showed that many
resonances are located within regions causing much of the disc material to be ejected before a planet is formed. Thus, the system might have two asteroid belts with Kirkwood gaps, similar to the Solar Systemś
main belt of asteroids. The co-orbital region proved to be extremely sensitive, not allowing the planet formation, but showing that this binary system has the capacity to have Trojan bodies. Finally, we looked for regions of stability for an Earth-sized moon. We found that there is stability for a moon with this mass up to 0.4 Hillś radius from
the host planet.},

By adopting eccentricity and inclination damping formulae based on hydrodynamical simulations (instead of the K-prescription), we have carried out 20 000 numerical simulations, where we vary the initial planetary eccentricities, the migration rate, and the dispersal time of the gas disc. Our results confirm that highly mutually inclined systems are unlikely to be produced by an inclination-type resonance of two migrating giant planets. However, in \${\textbackslash}sim 1{\textasciitilde}\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ of the simulations, inclination-type resonance is observed, and a dynamical study of the evolutions reveals that the inclination-type resonance mechanism operates in three cases: (I) when the inner planet reaches the inner cavity of the disc, (II) at moderate to high eccentricities for faster migration rates, and (III) at low to moderate eccentricities after a phase of orbital destabilization and re-arrangement.},

	abstract = {Context. Angular differential imaging (ADI) and spectral differential 
imaging (SDI) are well-established high-contrast imaging techniques, but
their application is challenging for companions at small angular
separations from their host stars. Aims: The aim of this paper is
to investigate to what extent adaptive-optics assisted,
medium-resolution (R 5000) integral field spectrographs (IFS) can be
used to directly detect the absorption of molecular species in the
spectra of planets and substellar companions when these are not present
in the spectrum of the star. Methods: We analysed archival data
of the β Pictoris system taken with the SINFONI integral field
spectrograph located at ESO's Very Large Telescope, originally taken to
image β Pictoris b using ADI techniques. At each spatial position
in the field, a scaled instance of the stellar spectrum is subtracted
from the data after which the residuals are cross-correlated with model
spectra. The cross-correlation co-adds the individual absorption lines
of the planet emission spectrum constructively, while this is not the
case for (residual) telluric and stellar features. Results:
Cross-correlation with CO and H2O models results in
significant detections of β Pictoris b with signal-to-noise ratios
(S/Ns) of 13.7 and 16.4 respectively. Correlation with a T = 1700 K
BT-Settl model provides a detection with an S/N of 22.8. This in
contrast to application of ADI, which barely reveals the planet. While
the adaptive optics system only achieved modest Strehl ratios of 19-27\%
leading to a raw contrast of 1:240 at the planet position,
cross-correlation achieves a 3σ contrast limit of 2.7 ×
10-5 in this 2.5 hr data set, a factor 40 below the raw
noise level at an angular distance of 0.36'' from the star. 
Conclusions: Adaptive-optics assisted, medium-resolution IFS, such as
SINFONI on the VLT and OSIRIS on the Keck Telescope, can be used for
high-contrast imaging utilizing cross-correlation techniques for planets
that are close to their star and embedded in speckle noise. We refer to
this method as molecule mapping, and advocate its application to
observations with future medium resolution instruments, in particular
ERIS on the VLT, HARMONI on the ELT and NIRSpec, and MIRI on the JWST.

	abstract = {Combining high-contrast imaging with medium-resolution spectroscopy has 
been shown to significantly boost the direct detection of exoplanets.
HARMONI, one of the first-light instruments to be mounted on ESO's ELT,
will be equipped with a single-conjugated adaptive optics system to
reach the diffraction limit of the ELT in H and K bands, a high-contrast
module dedicated to exoplanet imaging, and a medium-resolution (up to R
= 17 000) optical and near-infrared integral field spectrograph.
Combined together, these systems will provide unprecedented contrast
limits at separations between 50 and 400 mas. In this paper, we estimate
the capabilities of the HARMONI high-contrast module for the direct
detection of young giant exoplanets. We use an end-to-end model of the
instrument to simulate observations based on realistic observing
scenarios and conditions. We analyze these data with the so-called
"molecule mapping" technique combined to a matched-filter approach, in
order to disentangle the companions from the host star and tellurics,
and increase the S/N of the planetary signal. We detect planets above
5-sigma at contrasts up to 16 mag and separations down to 75 mas in
several spectral configurations of the instrument. We show that molecule
mapping allows the detection of companions up to 2.5 mag fainter
compared to state-of-the-art high-contrast imaging techniques based on
angular differential imaging. We also demonstrate that the performance
is not strongly affected by the spectral type of the host star, and that
we reach close sensitivities for the best three quartiles of observing
conditions at Armazones, which means that HARMONI could be used in
near-critical observations during 60 to 70\% of telescope time at the
ELT. Finally, we simulate planets from population synthesis models to
further explore the parameter space that HARMONI and its high-contrast
module will soon open.},

	abstract = {Sub-Neptunes (Rp{\textasciitilde}1.25-4 REarth) remain the most commonly detected 
exoplanets to date. However, it remains difficult for observations to
tell whether these intermediate-sized exoplanets have surfaces and where
their surfaces are located. Here we propose that the abundances of trace
species in the visible atmospheres of these sub-Neptunes can be used as
proxies for determining the existence of surfaces and approximate
surface conditions. As an example, we used a state-of-the-art
photochemical model to simulate the atmospheric evolution of K2-18b and
investigate its final steady-state composition with surfaces located at
different pressures levels (Psurf). We find the surface location has a
significant impact on the atmospheric abundances of trace species,
making them deviate significantly from their thermochemical equilibrium
and "no-surface" conditions. This result arises primarily because the
pressure-temperature conditions at the surface determine whether
photochemically-produced species can be recycled back to their favored
thermochemical-equilibrium forms and transported back to the upper
atmosphere. For an assumed H2-rich atmosphere for K2-18b, we identify
seven chemical species that are most sensitive to the existence of
surfaces: ammonia (NH3), methane (CH4), hydrogen cyanide (HCN),
acetylene (C2H2), ethane (C2H6), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon
dioxide (CO2). The ratio between the observed and the no-surface
abundances of these species, can help distinguish the existence of a
shallow surface (Psurf {\textless} 10 bar), an intermediate surface (10 bar
{\textless} Psurf {\textless} 100 bar), and a deep surface (Psurf {\textgreater} 100 bar). This
framework can be applied together with future observations to other

	abstract = {Inferring the properties of exoplanets from their atmospheres, while 
confronting low resolution and low signal-to-noise in the context of the
quantities we want to derive, poses rigorous demands upon the data
collected from observation. Further compounding this challenge is that
inferences of exoplanet properties are built from forward models, which
can include errors due to incomplete or inaccurate assumptions in
atmospheric physics and chemistry. The confluence of observational noise
and model error makes developing techniques to identify predictive
features that are robust to both low s/n and model error increasingly
important for exoplanet science. We demonstrate how both issues can be
addressed simultaneously by taking advantage of underutilized
multivariate information already present in current atmospheric models,
including thermodynamic statistics and reaction network structure. To do
so, we provide a case study of the prediction of vertical mixing
(parameterized as eddy diffusion) in hot Jupiter atmospheres and show
how prediction efficacy depends on what model information is used - e.g.
chemical species abundances, network statistics, and/or thermodynamic
statistics. We also show how the variables with the most predictive
power vary with planetary properties such as temperature and
metallicity. Our results demonstrate how inferences built on single
metrics do not have utility across all possible use cases. We also show
how statistical measures derived from network analyses tend to be better
predictors when accounting for the possibility of missing data or
observational uncertainty. We discuss future directions applying
multivariate and network model information as a framework for increasing
confidence in inferences aimed at extracting features relevant to
exoplanet atmospheres and future applications to the detection of life

	abstract = {[Abridged] The study of disc kinematics has recently opened up as a 
promising method to detect unseen planets. However, a systematic,
statistically meaningful analysis of such an approach remains missing.
The aim of this work is to devise an automated, statistically robust
technique to identify kinematical perturbations induced by the presence
of planets in a gas disc, and to accurately infer their location. For
this purpose, we produce hydro simulations of planet-disc interactions
with different planet masses, 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 \$M\_\{Jup\}\$, at a radius of
\$R=100\$ au in the disc, and perform radiative transfer calculations of
CO to simulate observables for 13 planet azimuths. Using the DISCMINER
package, we fit the synthetic data cubes with a Keplerian model of the
channel-by-channel emission to study line profile differences, including
deviations from Keplerian rotation. The detection technique, based on
line centroid differences, captures localised planet-driven
perturbations, and can distinguish them from axisymmetric velocity
perturbations. The method can detect all three simulated planets, at all
azimuths, with an average accuracy of \${\textbackslash}pm3{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ in azimuth and \${\textbackslash}pm8\$
au in radius. Owing to disc structure and line-of-sight projection
effects, planets at azimuths close to \${\textbackslash}pm45{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ yield the highest
velocity fluctuations, whereas those at limiting cases, \$0{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ and
\${\textbackslash}pm90{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$, drive the lowest. The observed peak velocities range
within 40\$-\$70, 70\$-\$170 and 130\$-\$450 m s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ for 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0
\$M\_\{Jup\}\$ planets. Our analysis indicates that the variance of peak
velocities is boosted near planets due to organised gas motions prompted
by their localised gravitational well. We propose an approach that
exploits this velocity coherence to provide, for the first time,
statistically significant detections of localised planet-driven
perturbations in the gas disc kinematics.},

	abstract = {Recent multi-wavelength ALMA observations of the protoplanetary disk orbiting around Elias 2-27 revealed a two armed spiral structure. The observed morphology together with the young age of the star and the disk-to-star mass ratio estimated from dust continuum emission make this system a perfect laboratory to investigate the role of self-gravity in the early phases of star formation. This is particularly interesting if we consider that gravitational instabilities could be a fundamental first step for the formation of planetesimals and planets. In this Letter, we model the rotation curve obtained by CO data of Elias 2-27 with a theoretical rotation curve including both the disk self-gravity and the star contribution to the gravitational potential. We compare this model with a purely Keplerian one and with a simple power-law function. We find that (especially for the \${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$CO isotopologue) the rotation curve is better described by considering not only the star, but also the disk self-gravity. We are thus able to obtain for the first time a dynamical estimate of the disk mass of \$0.08{\textbackslash}pm0.04{\textbackslash},M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and the star mass of \$0.46{\textbackslash}pm0.03{\textbackslash},M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ (in the more general case), the latter being comparable with previous estimates. From these values, we derive that the disk is 17\${\textbackslash}\%\$ of the star mass, meaning that it could be prone to gravitational instabilities. This result would strongly support the hypothesis that the two spiral arms are generated by gravitational instabilities.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian dynamics can be used to produce distant proposals for the Metropolis algorithm, thereby avoiding the slow exploration of the state space that results from the diffusive behaviour of simple random-walk proposals. Though originating in physics, Hamiltonian dynamics can be applied to most problems with continuous state spaces by simply introducing fictitious "momentum" variables. A key to its usefulness is that Hamiltonian dynamics preserves volume, and its trajectories can thus be used to define complex mappings without the need to account for a hard-to-compute Jacobian factor - a property that can be exactly maintained even when the dynamics is approximated by discretizing time. In this review, I discuss theoretical and practical aspects of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and present some of its variations, including using windows of states for deciding on acceptance or rejection, computing trajectories using fast approximations, tempering during the course of a trajectory to handle isolated modes, and short-cut methods that prevent useless trajectories from taking much computation time.},

We aim to conﬁrm the presence of Proxima b using independent measurements obtained with the new ESPRESSO spectrograph, and reﬁne the planetary parameters taking advantage of its improved precision. Methods. We analysed 63 spectroscopic ESPRESSO observations of Proxima (Gl 551) taken during 2019. We obtained radial velocity measurements with a typical radial velocity photon noise of 26 cm·s−1. We combined these data with archival spectroscopic observations and newly obtained photometric measurements to model the stellar activity signals and disentangle them from planetary signals in the radial velocity (RV) data. We ran a joint Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis on the time series of the RV and full width half maximum of the cross-correlation function to model the planetary and stellar signals present in the data, applying Gaussian process regression to deal with the stellar activity signals.},

	abstract = {In the search for planets orbiting distant stars the presence of stellar activity in the atmospheres of observed stars can obscure the radial velocity signal used to detect such planets. Furthermore, this stellar activity contamination is set by the star itself and cannot simply be avoided with better instrumentation. Various stellar activity indicators have been developed that may correlate with this contamination. We introduce a new stellar activity indicator called the Stellar Activity F-statistic for Exoplanet surveys (SAFE) that has higher statistical power (i.e., probability of detecting a true stellar activity signal) than many traditional stellar activity indicators in a simulation study of an active region on a Sun-like star with moderate to high signal-to-noise. Also through simulation, the SAFE is demonstrated to be associated with the projected area on the visible side of the star covered by active regions. We also demonstrate that the SAFE detects statistically significant stellar activity in most of the spectra for HD 22049, a star known to have high stellar variability. Additionally, the SAFE is calculated for recent observations of the three low-variability stars HD 34411, HD 10700, and HD 3651, the latter of which is known to have a planetary companion. As expected, the SAFE for these three only occasionally detects activity. Furthermore, initial exploration appears to indicate that the SAFE may be useful for disentangling stellar activity signals from planet-induced Doppler shifts.},

	abstract = {Methods. We compute the time evolution of star-planet systems consisting of a planet with initial mass between 0.02 and 2.5 MJup (6 and 800 MEarth), in a quasi-circular orbit with an initial orbital distance between 0.01 and 0.10 au, around a solar-type star evolving from the Pre-Main-Sequence (PMS) until the end of the Main-Sequence (MS) phase. We account for the evolution of: the stellar structure, the stellar angular momentum due to tides and magnetic braking, the tidal interactions (equilibrium and dynamical tides in stellar convective zones), the mass-evaporation of the planet, and the secular evolution of the planetary orbit. We consider that at the beginning of the evolution, the proto-planetary disk has fully dissipated and planet formation is complete.
Results. Both a rapid initial stellar rotation, and a more eﬃcient angular momentum transport inside the star, in general, contribute toward the enlargement of the domain which is devoid of planets after the PMS phase, in the plane of planet mass vs. orbital distance. Comparisons with the observed distribution of exoplanets orbiting solar mass stars, in the plane of planet mass vs. orbital distance (addressing the "Neptunian desert" feature), show an encouraging agreement with the present simulations, especially since no attempts have been made to ﬁne-tune initial parameters of the models to ﬁt the observations. We also obtain an upper limit for the orbital period of bare-core planets, that agrees with observations of the "radius valley" feature in the plane of planet radius vs. orbital period.
Conclusions. The two eﬀects, tides and planet evaporation, should be accounted for simultaneously and in a consistent way, with a detailed model for the evolution of the star.},

	abstract = {Gaps in protoplanetary disks have long been hailed as signposts of planet formation. However, a direct link between exoplanets and disks remains hard to identify. We present a large sample study of ALMA disk surveys of nearby starforming regions to disentangle this connection. All disks are classiﬁed as either structured (transition, ring, extended) or non-structured (compact) disks. Although low-resolution observations may not identify large scale substructure, we assume that an extended disk must contain substructure from a dust evolution argument. A comparison across ages reveals that structured disks retain high dust masses up to at least 10 Myr, whereas the dust mass of compact, non-structured disks decreases over time. This can be understood if the dust mass evolves primarily by radial drift, unless drift is prevented by pressure bumps. We identify a stellar mass dependence of the fraction of structured disks. We propose a scenario linking this dependence with that of giant exoplanet occurrence rates. We show that there are enough exoplanets to account for the observed disk structures if transitional disks are created by exoplanets more massive than Jupiter, and ring disks by exoplanets more massive than Neptune, under the assumption that most of those planets eventually migrate inwards. On the other hand, the known anti-correlation between transiting super-Earths and stellar mass implies those planets must form in the disks without observed structure, consistent with formation through pebble accretion in drift-dominated disks. These ﬁndings support an evolutionary scenario where the early formation of giant planets determines the disk’s dust evolution and its observational appearance.},

	abstract = {Oxygen is a promising exoplanet biosignature due to the evolutionary advantage conferred by harnessing starlight for photosynthesis, and the apparent low likelihood of maintaining oxygenrich atmospheres without life. Hypothetical scenarios have been proposed for non-biological oxygen accumulation on planets around late M-dwarfs, where the extended pre-main sequence may favor abiotic O2 accumulation. In contrast, abiotic oxygen accumulation on planets around F, G, and K-type stars is seemingly less likely, provided they possess substantial non-condensable gas inventories. The comparative robustness of oxygen biosignatures around larger stars has motivated plans for next-generation telescopes capable of oxygen detection on planets around sun-like stars. However, the general tendency of terrestrial planets to develop oxygen-rich atmospheres across a broad range of initial conditions and evolutionary scenarios has not been explored. Here, we use a coupled thermal-geochemical-climate model of terrestrial planet evolution to illustrate three scenarios whereby significant abiotic oxygen can accumulate around sun-like stars, even when significant noncondensable gas inventories are present. For Earth-mass planets, we find abiotic oxygen can accumulate to modern levels if (1) the CO2:H2O ratio of the initial volatile inventory is high, (2) the initial water inventory exceeds ∼50 Earth oceans, or (3) the initial water inventory is very low ({\textless}0.3 Earth oceans). Fortunately, these three abiotic oxygen scenarios could be distinguished from biological oxygen with observations of other atmospheric constituents or characterizing the planetary surface. This highlights the need for broadly capable next-generation telescopes that are equipped to constrain surface water inventories via time-resolved photometry and search for temporal biosignatures or disequilibrium combination biosignatures to assess whether oxygen is biogenic.},

	abstract = {We present a novel, iterative method using an empirical Bayesian approach for modeling the limb darkened WASP-121b transit from the TESS light curve. Our method is motivated by the need to improve Rp/R∗ estimates for exoplanet atmosphere modeling, and is particularly eﬀective with the limb darkening (LD) quadratic law requiring no prior central value from stellar atmospheric models. With the non-linear LD law, the method has all the advantages of not needing atmospheric models but does not converge. The iterative method gives a diﬀerent Rp/R∗ for WASP-121b at a signiﬁcance level of 1σ when compared with existing non-iterative methods. To assess the origins and implications of this diﬀerence, we generate and analyze light curves with known values of the limb darkening coeﬃcients (LDCs). We ﬁnd that non-iterative modeling with LDC priors from stellar atmospheric models results in an inconsistent Rp/R∗ at 1.5σ level when the known LDC values are as those previously found when modeling real data by the iterative method. In contrast, the LDC values from the iterative modeling yields the correct value of Rp/R∗ to within 0.25σ. For more general cases with diﬀerent known inputs, Monte Carlo simulations show that the iterative method obtains unbiased LDCs and correct Rp/R∗ to within a signiﬁcance level of 0.3σ. Biased LDC priors can cause biased LDC posteriors and lead to bias in the Rp/R∗ of up to 0.82\%, 2.5σ for the quadratic law and 0.32\%, 1.0σ for the non-linear law. Our improvement in Rp/R∗ estimation is important when analyzing exoplanet atmospheres.},

	abstract = {Selection among alternative theoretical models given an observed dataset is an important challenge in many areas of physics and astronomy. Reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) is an extremely powerful technique for performing Bayesian model selection, but it suffers from a fundamental difficulty and it requires jumps between model parameter spaces, but cannot efficiently explore both parameter spaces at once. Thus, a naive jump between parameter spaces is unlikely to be accepted in the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm and convergence is correspondingly slow. Here, we demonstrate an interpolation technique that uses samples from single-model MCMCs to propose intermodel jumps from an approximation to the single-model posterior of the target parameter space. The interpolation technique, based on a kD-tree data structure, is adaptive and efficient in modest dimensionality. We show that our technique leads to improved convergence over naive jumps in an RJMCMC, and compare it to other proposals in the literature to improve the convergence of RJMCMCs. We also demonstrate the use of the same interpolation technique as a way to construct efficient ‘global’ proposal distributions for single-model MCMCs without prior knowledge of the structure of the posterior distribution, and discuss improvements that permit the method to be used in higher dimensional spaces efficiently.},

planet does not have a clear primordial, hydrogen-dominated atmosphere.
Instead, GJ 1132 b could have a cloudy hydrogen-dominated envelope, a
very enriched secondary atmosphere, be airless, or have a tenuous
atmosphere that has not been detected. Due to the narrow wavelength
coverage of WFC3, these scenarios cannot be distinguished yet but the
James Webb Space Telescope may be capable of detecting atmospheric
features, although several observations may be required to provide
useful constraints.},

We focus on the validation of the model built from a collection of data mostly from Venus Express experiments and coordinated ground-based telescope campaigns, in the upper mesosphere/lower thermosphere of Venus. These simulations result in an overall better agreement with temperature observations above 90 km, compared with previous versions of the VGCM. Density of CO2 and light species (CO and O) are also comparable with observations in terms of trend and order of magnitude. Systematic biases in the temperature structure are found at about 80-100 km and above 130 km at the terminator, possibly due to assumptions on the CO2 mixing ratio made for stellar/solar occultation retrievals and uncertainties on the collisional rate coefficients used in the non-LTE parameterization, respectively. Diurnal and latitudinal distribution of dynamical tracers are also analyzed. Overall, our simulations indicate that a weak westward retrograde wind is present up to about 120 km, producing the CO bulge displacement toward 2h-3h in the morning, instead of piling up at the anti-solar point, as for an idealised SS-AS circulation. This retrograde imbalance is suggested to be produced by perturbations of about 5 days Kelvin wave impacting the mesosphere up to 110 km (see the companion paper Navarro et al. 2021), combined with GW westward acceleration mostly above 110 km. On the whole, these model developments point to the importance of the inclusion of the lower atmosphere, higher resolution and finely tuned parameterizations in GCM of the Venusian upper atmosphere, in order to shed light on existing observations.},

	abstract = {We analyse emission spectra of WASP-12b from a partial phase curve observed over three epochs with the Hubble Space Telescope, covering eclipse, quadrature, and transit, respectively. As the 1.1-day period phase curve was only partially covered over three epochs, traditional methods to extract the planet flux and instrument systematic errors cannot recover the thermal emission away from the secondary eclipse. To analyse this partial phase curve, we introduce a new method, which corrects for the wavelength-independent component of the systematic errors. Our new method removes the achromatic instrument and stellar variability, and uses the measured stellar spectrum in eclipse to then retrieve a relative planetary spectrum in wavelength at each phase. We are able to extract the emission spectrum of an exoplanet at quadrature outside of a phase curve for the first time; we recover the quadrature spectrum of WASP-12b up to an additive constant. The dayside emission spectrum is extracted in a similar manner, and in both cases we are able to estimate the brightness temperature, albeit at a greatly reduced precision. We estimate the brightness temperature from the dayside (Tday=3186+-677 K) and from the quadrature spectrum (Tquad=2124+-417 K) and combine them to constrain the energy budget of the planet. We compare our extracted relative spectra to global circulation models of this planet, which are generally found to be a good match. However, we do see tentative evidence of a steeper spectral slope in the measured dayside spectrum compared to our models. We find that we cannot match this increased slope by increasing optical opacities in our models. We also find that this spectral slope is unlikely to be explained by a non-equilibrium water abundance, as water advected from the nightside is quickly dissociated on the dayside.},

	abstract = {Context. Planet formation is expected to take place in the first million 
years of a planetary system through various processes, which remain to
be tested through observations. Aims: With the recent discovery,
using ALMA, of two gaseous spiral arms inside the ∼120 au cavity and
connected to dusty spirals, the famous protoplanetary disk around AB
Aurigae presents a strong incentive for investigating the mechanisms
that lead to giant planet formation. A candidate protoplanet located
inside a spiral arm has already been claimed in an earlier study based
on the same ALMA data. Methods: We used SPHERE at the Very Large
Telescope to perform near-infrared high-contrast imaging of AB Aur in
polarized and unpolarized light in order to study the morphology of the
disk and search for signs of planet formation. Results: SPHERE
has delivered the deepest images ever obtained for AB Aur in scattered
light. Among the many structures that are yet to be understood, we
identified not only the inner spiral arms, but we also resolved a
feature in the form of a twist in the eastern spiral at a separation of
about 30 au. The twist of the spiral is perfectly reproduced with a
planet-driven density wave model when projection effects are accounted
for. We measured an azimuthal displacement with respect to the
counterpart of this feature in the ALMA data, which is consistent with
Keplerian motion on a 4 yr baseline. Another point sxce is detected near
the edge of the inner ring, which is likely the result of scattering as
opposed to the direct emission from a planet photosphere. We tentatively
derived mass constraints for these two features. Conclusions: The
twist and its apparent orbital motion could well be the first direct
evidence of a connection between a protoplanet candidate and its
manifestation as a spiral imprinted in the gas and dust distributions.

	abstract = {Recent observations of the protoplanetary disc surrounding AB Aurigae have revealed the possible presence of two giant planets in the process of forming. The young measured age of \$1-4\$Myr for this system allows us to place strict time constraints on the formation histories of the observed planets. Hence we may be able to make a crucial distinction between formation through core accretion (CA) or the gravitational instability (GI), as CA formation timescales are typically Myrs whilst formation through GI will occur within the first \${\textbackslash}approx10{\textasciicircum}4-10{\textasciicircum}5\$yrs of disc evolution. We focus our analysis on the \$4-13\$M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Jup\}\$ planet observed at \$R{\textbackslash}approx30\$AU. We find CA formation timescales for such a massive planet typically exceed the system's age. The planet's high mass and wide orbit may instead be indicative of formation through GI. We use smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations to determine the system's critical disc mass for fragmentation, finding \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm d,crit\}=0.3\$M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. Viscous evolution models of the disc's mass history indicate that it was likely massive enough to exceed \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm d,crit\}\$ in the recent past, thus it is possible that a young AB Aurigae disc may have fragmented to form multiple giant gaseous protoplanets. Calculations of the Jeans mass in an AB Aurigae-like disc find that fragments may initially form with masses \$1.6-13.3\$M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Jup\}\$, consistent with the planets which have been observed. We therefore propose that the inferred planets in the disc surrounding AB Aurigae may be evidence of planet formation through GI.},

	abstract = {The eccentricity of a planet's orbit and the inclination of its orbital 
plane encode important information about its formation and history.
However, exoplanets detected via direct-imaging are often only observed
over a very small fraction of their period, making it challenging to
perform reliable physical inferences given wide, unconstrained
posteriors. The aim of this project is to investigate biases (deviation
of the median and mode of the posterior from the true values of orbital
parameters, and the width and coverage of their credible intervals) in
the estimation of orbital parameters of directly-imaged exoplanets,
particularly their eccentricities, and to define general guidelines to
perform better estimations of uncertainty. For this, we constructed
various orbits and generated mock data for each spanning \${\textbackslash}sim 0.5 {\textbackslash}\%\$
of the orbital period. We used the Orbits For The Impatient (OFTI)
algorithm to compute orbit posteriors, and compared those to the true
values of the orbital parameters. We found that the inclination of the
orbital plane is the parameter that most affects our estimations of
eccentricity, with orbits that appear near edge-on producing
eccentricity distributions skewed away from the true values, and often
bi-modal. We also identified a degeneracy between eccentricity and
inclination that makes it difficult to distinguish posteriors of
face-on, eccentric orbits and edge-on, circular orbits. For the
exoplanet-imaging community, we propose practical recommendations,
guidelines and warnings relevant to orbit-fitting.},

exoplanetary transit light-curves for transmission spectroscopy studies
(Available at https://github.com/joshjchayes/TransitFit and
https://github.com/spearnet/TransitFit, with documentation at
https://transitfit.readthedocs.io/). TransitFit employs nested sampling
to offer efficient and robust multi-epoch, multi-wavelength fitting of
transit data obtained from one or more telescopes. TransitFit allows
per-telescope detrending to be performed simultaneously with parameter
fitting, including the use of user-supplied detrending alogorithms. Host
limb darkening can be fitted either independently ("uncoupled") for each
filter or combined ("coupled") using prior conditioning from the PHOENIX
stellar atmosphere models. For this TransitFit uses the Limb Darkening
Toolkit (LDTk) together with filter profiles, including user-supplied
filter profiles. We demonstrate the application of TransitFit in three
different contexts. First, we model SPEARNET broadband optical data of
the low-density hot-Neptune WASP-127{\textasciitilde}b. The data were obtained from a
globally-distributed network of 0.5m--2.4m telescopes. We find clear
improvement in our broadband results using the coupled mode over
uncoupled mode, when compared against the higher spectral resolution
GTC/OSIRIS transmission spectrum obtained by Chen et al. (2018). Using
TransitFit, we fit 26 transit observations by TESS to recover improved
ephemerides of the hot-Jupiter WASP-91{\textasciitilde}b and a transit depth determined
to a precision of 170{\textasciitilde}ppm. Finally, we use TransitFit to conduct an
investigation into the contested presence of TTV signatures in
WASP-126{\textasciitilde}b using 126 transits observed by TESS, concluding that there is
no statistically significant evidence for such signatures from
observations spanning 31 TESS sectors.},

TESS planets orbit around bright host stars. TOI-263b is a validated
ultra-short period substellar object in a 0.56-day orbit around a faint
(V=18.97) M3.5 dwarf star. The substellar nature of TOI-263b was
explored using multi-color photometry, which determined a true radius of
0.87+-0.21 Rj, establishing TOI-263b's nature ranging from an inflated
Neptune to a brown dwarf. The orbital period-radius parameter space
occupied by TOI-263b is quite unique, which prompted a further
characterization of its true nature. Here, we report radial velocity
measurements of TOI-263 obtained with 3 VLT units and the ESPRESSO
spectrograph to retrieve the mass of TOI-263b. We find that TOI-263b is
a brown dwarf with a mass of 61.6+-4.0 Mj. Additionally, the orbital
period of the brown dwarf is found to be synchronized with the rotation
period of the host star, and the system is found to be relatively
active, possibly revealing a star--brown dwarf interaction. All these
findings suggest that the system's formation history might be explained
via disc fragmentation and later migration to close-in orbits. If the
system is found to be unstable, TOI-263 is an excellent target to test
the migration mechanisms before the brown dwarf becomes engulfed by its
parent star.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09252},
	abstract = {Direct imaging of exoplanets is usually limited by quasi-static speckles. These uncorrected aberrations in a star's point spread function (PSF) obscure faint companions and limit the sensitivity of high-contrast imaging instruments. Most current approaches to processing differential imaging sequences like angular differential imaging (ADI) and spectral differential imaging (SDI) produce a self-calibrating dataset that are combined in a linear least squares solution to minimize the noise. Due to temporal and chromatic evolution of a telescope's PSF, the best correlated reference images are usually the most contaminated by the planet, leading to self-subtraction and reducing the planet throughput. In this paper, we present an algorithm that directly optimizes the non-linear equation for planet signal to noise ratio (SNR). This new algorithm does not require us to reject adjacent reference images and optimally balances noise reduction with self-subtraction. We then show how this algorithm can be applied to multiple images simultaneously for a further reduction in correlated noise, directly maximizing the SNR of the final combined image. Finally, we demonstrate the technique on an illustrative sequence of HR8799 using the new Julia-based Signal to Noise Analysis Pipeline (SNAP). We show that SNR optimization can provide up to a \$5{\textbackslash}times\$ improvement in contrast close to the star. Applicable to both new and archival data, this technique will allow for the detection of lower mass, and closer in companions, or achieve the same sensitivity with less telescope time.},

sequence stars, with radii and masses between \$1.10-1.30\$ \$R\_J\$ and

planets' small orbital separations (\$0.039-0.052\$ AU), we find that all
four hot Jupiters are highly irradiated and therefore occupy a region of
parameter space in which planetary inflation mechanisms become
effective. Comparison with statistical studies and a consideration of
the planets' high incident fluxes reveals that NGTS-16b, NGTS-17b, and
NGTS-18b are indeed likely inflated, although some disparities arise
upon analysis with current Bayesian inflationary models. However, the
underlying relationships which govern radius inflation remain poorly
understood. We postulate that the inclusion of additional
hyperparameters to describe latent factors such as heavy element
fraction, as well as the addition of an updated catalogue of hot
Jupiters, would refine inflationary models, thus furthering our
understanding of the physical processes which give rise to inflated
planets.},

low-mass host stars are considered to produce weak emission signals at
radio frequencies. A study using LOFAR data announced the detection of
radio emission from the mid M-type dwarf GJ 1151 that could potentially
arise from a close-in terrestrial planet. Recently, the presence of a
2.5-Me planet orbiting GJ 1151 with a 2-day period has been claimed
using 69 radial velocities (RVs) from the HARPS-N and HPF instruments.
We have obtained 70 new high-precision RV measurements in the framework
of the CARMENES M-dwarf survey and use these data to confirm the
presence of the claimed planet and to place limits on possible planetary
companions in the GJ 1151 system. We analyse the periodicities present
in the combined RV data sets from all three instruments and calculate
the detection limits for potential planets in short-period orbits. We
cannot confirm the recently-announced candidate planet and conclude that
the 2-day signal in the HARPS-N and HPF data sets is most probably
produced by a combination of the time sampling and long-term RV
variability, the latter possibly arising from an outer planetary
companion yet unconstrained. We calculate a 99.9\% significance detection

evaporation, making it essential to characterize the stellar high-energy
radiation that drives this mechanism. This is particularly important
with M dwarfs, which emit a large and variable fraction of their
luminosity in the UV and can display strong flaring behavior. The warm
Neptune GJ3470b, hosted by an M2 dwarf, was found to harbor a giant
hydrogen exosphere thanks to 3 transits observed with the HST/STIS. Here
we report on 3 additional transit observations from the PanCET program,
obtained with the HST/COS. These data confirm the absorption signature
from GJ3470b's exosphere in the stellar Ly-alpha line and demonstrate
its stability over time. No planetary signatures are detected in other
lines, setting a 3sigma limit on GJ3470b's FUV radius at 1.3x its Roche
lobe radius. We detect 3 flares from GJ3470. They show different
spectral energy distributions but peak consistently in the Si III line,
which traces intermediate-temperature layers in the transition region.
These layers appear to play a particular role in GJ3470's activity as
emission lines that form at lower or higher temperatures than Si III
evolved differently over the long term. Based on the measured emission
lines, we derive synthetic XUV spectra for the 6 observed quiescent
phases, covering one year, as well as for the 3 flaring episodes. Our
results suggest that most of GJ3470's quiescent high-energy emission
comes from the EUV domain, with flares amplifying the FUV emission more
strongly. The hydrogen photoionization lifetimes and mass loss derived
for GJ3470b show little variation over the epochs, in agreement with the
stability of the exosphere. Simulations informed by our XUV spectra are
required to understand the atmospheric structure and evolution of
GJ3470b and the role played by evaporation in the formation of the
hot-Neptune desert.},

	abstract = {Context. The high number of super-Earth and Earth-like planets in the 
habitable zone (HZ) detected around M-dwarf stars in the last years has
revealed these stellar objects to be the key for planetary radial
velocity (RV) searches. Aims. Using the HARPS-N spectrograph within The
HArps-n red Dwarf Exoplanet Survey (HADES) we reach the precision needed
to detect small planets with a few Earth masses using the RV technique.
Methods. We obtained 138 HARPS-N RV measurements between 2013 May and
2020 September of GJ 720 A, classified as an M0.5V star located at a
distance of 15.56 pc. To characterize the stellar variability and to
discern the periodic variation due to the Keplerian signals from those
related to stellar activity, the HARPS-N spectroscopic activity
indicators and the simultaneous photometric observations were analyzed.
The combined analysis of HARPS-N RVs and activity indicators let us to
address the nature of the periodic signals. The final model and the
orbital planetary parameters were obtained by fitting simultaneously the
stellar variability and the Keplerian signal using a Gaussian process
regression and following a Bayesian criterion. Results. The HARPS-N RV
periodic signals around 40 d and 100 d have counterparts at the same
frequencies in HARPS-N activity indicators and photometric light curves.
Then we attribute these periodicities to stellar activity the former
period being likely associated with the stellar rotation. GJ 720 A shows
the most significant signal at 19.466\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.005 d with no counterparts
in any stellar activity indices. We hence ascribe this RV signal, having
a semiamplitude of 4.72\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.27 m/s , to the presence of a sub-Neptune
mass planet. The planet GJ 720 Ab has a minimum mass of 13.64\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.79

in the evolution of Earth's climate and, therefore, may also be an
important mechanism in the evolution of the climates of Earth-like
exoplanets. Aims: We investigate the effects of radiogenic mantle
heating, core size, and planetary mass on the evolution of the
atmospheric partial \$CO\_2\$ pressure, and the ability of a long-term
carbon cycle driven by plate tectonics to control the atmospheric \$CO\_2\$
pressure. Methods: We developed a box-model which connects carbon
cycling to parametrized mantle convection. The carbon cycle was coupled
to the thermal evolution via the plate speed, which depends on the
global Rayleigh number. Results: We find decreasing atmospheric \$CO\_2\$
pressure with time, up to an order of magnitude over 10 Gyr. Higher
abundances of radioactive isotopes result in higher \$CO\_2\$ pressures. We
find a decreasing Rayleigh number and plate speed toward planets with
larger core mass fractions \$f\_c\$, which leads to lower atmospheric
\$CO\_2\$ pressure. More massive planets may favor the development of more
\$CO\_2\$ rich atmospheres due to hotter interiors. Conclusions: The
dependence of plate tectonics on mantle cooling has a significant effect
on the long-term evolution of the atmospheric \$CO\_2\$ pressure. Carbon
cycling mediated by plate tectonics is efficient in regulating planetary
climates for a wide range of mantle radioactive isotope abundances,
planet masses and core sizes. More efficient carbon cycling on planets
with a high mantle abundance of thorium or uranium highlights the
importance of mapping the abundances of these elements in host stars of
potentially habitable exoplanets. Inefficient carbon recycling on
planets with a large core mass fraction (\$f\_c{\textbackslash}gtrsim 0.8\$) emphasizes
the importance of precise mass-radius measurements of Earth-sized
exoplanets.},

With JWST's impending launch, it is crucial we are well prepared to understand the subtleties of terrestrial atmospheres - particularly ones we may have not needed to consider before due to instrumentation limitations. In this work we show that patchy ice cloud variability is present in the upper atmospheres of M-dwarf terrestrial planets, particularly along the limbs. Here we test whether these variable clouds will introduce unexpected biases in the multi-epoch observations necessary to constrain atmospheric abundances. Using 3D ExoCAM general circulation models (GCMs) of TRAPPIST-1e, we simulate five different climates with varying pCO\$\_2\$ to explore the strength of this variability. These models are post-processed using NASA Goddard's Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG) and PandExo to generate simulated observations with JWST's NIRSpec PRISM mode at 365 different temporal outputs from each climate. Assuming the need for 10 transits of TRAPPIST-1e to detect molecular features at great confidence, we then use CHIMERA to retrieve on several randomly selected weighted averages of our simulated observations to explore the effect of multi-epoch observations with variable cloud cover along the limb on retrieved abundances. We find that the variable spectra do not affect retrieved abundances at detectable levels for our sample of TRAPPIST-1e models.},

Firstly, N2 as main gas is unique on the terrestrial planets in the inner solar system and gives a hint for tectonic activity. Studying the origins of atmospheric nitrogen and its stability provides insights into the uniqueness of the Earth's habitat. Secondly, the coexistence of N2 and O2 within an atmosphere is unequaled in the entire solar system. Such a combination is strongly linked to the existence of aerobic lifeforms. The availability of nitrogen on the surface, in the ocean, and within the atmosphere can enable or prevent the habitability of a terrestrial planet, since nitrogen is vitally required by all known lifeforms. In the present work, the different origins of atmospheric nitrogen, the stability of nitrogen dominated atmospheres, and the development of early Earth's atmospheric N2 are discussed. We show why
N2-O2-atmospheres constitute a biomarker not only for any lifeforms but for aerobic lifeforms, which was the first major step that led to higher developed life on Earth.},

We estimated through a

We found that at the nominal cadence Ariel will be able to measure the transit time with a precision of about 12s and 34s, for a star as bright as 55 Cnc and K2-24, respectively. We then ran dynamical simulations, also including the Ariel timing errors, and we found an improvement on the measurement of planetary masses of about \$20-30{\textbackslash}\%\$ in a K2-24-like planetary system through TTVs.

These are convolutional neural networks which work on radio frequency-time and dispersion measure-time images as the inputs. We trained these networks using simulated FRBs and real RFI candidates from telescopes at the Green Bank Observatory. We present 11 deep learning models, each with an accuracy and recall above 99.5 per cent on our test data set comprising of real RFI and pulsar candidates. As we demonstrate, these algorithms are telescope and frequency agnostic and are able to detect all FRBs with signal-to-noise ratios above 10 in ASKAP and Parkes data.

	abstract = {Super-Earths and sub-Neptunes are commonly thought to have accreted hydrogen/helium envelopes, consisting of a few to ten percent of their total mass, from the primordial gas disk. Subsequently, hydrodynamic escape driven by core-powered mass-loss and/or photo-evaporation likely stripped much of these primordial envelopes from the lower-mass and closer-in planets to form the super-Earth population. In this work we show that after undergoing core-powered mass-loss, some super-Earths can retain small residual H/He envelopes. This retention is possible because, for significantly depleted atmospheres, the density at the radiative-convective boundary drops sufficiently such that thhe cooling time-scale becomes less than the mass-loss time-scale. The residual envelope is therefore able to contract, terminating further mass loss. Using analytic calculations and numerical simulations, we show that the mass of primordial H/He envelope retained as a fraction of the planet's total mass, \$f\_\{ret\}\$, increases with increasing planet mass, \$M\_\{c\}\$, and decreases with increasing equilibrium temperature, \$T\_\{eq\}\$, scaling as \$f\_\{ret\} {\textbackslash}propto M\_\{c\}{\textasciicircum}\{3/2\} T\_\{eq\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1/2\} {\textbackslash}exp\{\vphantom{\}}[M\_\{c\}{\textasciicircum}\{3/4\}
T\_\{eq\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\vphantom{\{}\}]\}\$. \$f\_\{ret\}\$ varies from \${\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{-8\}\$ to about \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ for typical super-Earth parameters. To first order, the exact amount of left-over H/He depends on the initial envelope mass, the planet mass, its equilibrium temperature, and the envelope's opacity. These residual hydrogen envelopes reduce the atmosphere's mean molecular weight compared to a purely secondary atmosphere, a signature observable by current and future facilities. These remnant atmospheres may, however, in many cases be vulnerable to long-term erosion by photo-evaporation. Any residual hydrogen envelope likely plays an important role in the long-term physical evolution of super-Earths, including their geology and geochemistry.},

Dynamically informed habitable zones have been used in the past to investigate the habitability of circumstellar planets in binary systems and Earth-like analogs in systems with giant planets. Here, we extend the concept to potentially habitable worlds on circumbinary orbits. We show that habitable zone borders can be found analytically even when another giant planet is present in the system. By applying this methodology to Kepler-16, Kepler-34, Kepler-35, Kepler-38, Kepler-64, Kepler-413, Kepler-453, Kepler-1647 and Kepler-1661 we demonstrate that the presence of the known giant planets in the majority of those systems does not preclude the existence of potentially habitable worlds.

	abstract = {Atmospheric retrievals of exoplanetary transmission spectra provide important constraints on various properties such as chemical abundances, cloud/haze properties, and characteristic temperatures, at the day-night atmospheric terminator. To date, most spectra have been observed for giant exoplanets due to which retrievals typically assume H-rich atmospheres. However, recent observations of mini-Neptunes/super-Earths, and the promise of upcoming facilities including JWST, call for a new generation of retrievals that can address a wide range of atmospheric compositions and related complexities. Here we report Aurora, a
next-generation atmospheric retrieval framework that builds upon state-of-the-art architectures and incorporates the following key advancements: a) a generalised compositional retrieval allowing for H-rich and H-poor atmospheres, b) a generalised prescription for inhomogeneous clouds/hazes, c) multiple Bayesian inference algorithms for high-dimensional retrievals, d) modular considerations for
refraction, forward scattering, and Mie-scattering, and e) noise modeling functionalities. We demonstrate Aurora on current and/or synthetic observations of hot Jupiter HD209458b, mini-Neptune K218b, and rocky exoplanet TRAPPIST1d. Using current HD209458b spectra, we
demonstrate the robustness of our framework and cloud/haze prescription against assumptions of H-rich/H-poor atmospheres, improving on previous treatments. Using real and synthetic spectra of K218b, we demonstrate the agnostic approach to confidently constrain its bulk atmospheric composition and obtain precise abundance estimates.

are reported, based on measurements with the SOPHIE spectrograph.
Current data do not allow us to distinguish between a 12.95-day period
and its one-day alias at 1.08 days, but favour the former slightly. The
velocity variation has an amplitude of 1.6 m s-1, making this
the lowest-amplitude signal detected with SOPHIE up to now. We have
performed a detailed analysis of the significance of the signal and its
origin, including extensive simulations with both uncorrelated and
correlated noise, representing the signal induced by stellar activity.
The signal is significantly detected, and the results from all tests
point to its planetary origin. Additionally, the presence of an
additional acceleration in the velocity time series is suggested by the
current data. On the other hand, a previously reported signal with a
period of 9.9 days, detected in HIRES velocities of this star, is not
recovered in the SOPHIE data. An independent analysis of the HIRES
dataset also fails to unveil the 9.9-day signal. If the 12.95-day period
is the real one, the amplitude of the signal detected with SOPHIE
implies the presence of a planet, called Gl 411 b, with a minimum mass
of around three Earth masses, orbiting its star at a distance of 0.079
AU. The planet receives about 3.5 times the insolation received by
Earth, which implies an equilibrium temperature between 256 and 350 K,
and makes it too hot to be in the habitable zone. At a distance of only
2.5 pc, Gl 411 b, is the third closest low-mass planet detected to date.
Its proximity to Earth will permit probing its atmosphere with a
combination of high-contrast imaging and high-dispersion spectroscopy in
the next decade.

	abstract = {Data suggest that most rocky exoplanets with orbital period \$p\$ \${\textless}\$ 100 d ("hot" rocky exoplanets) formed as gas-rich sub-Neptunes that subsequently lost most of their envelopes, but whether these rocky exoplanets still have atmospheres is unknown. We identify a pathway by which 1-1.7 \$R\_\{Earth\}\$ (1-10 \$M\_\{Earth\}\$) rocky exoplanets with orbital periods of 10-100 days can acquire long-lived 10-2000 bar atmospheres that are H\$\_2\$O-dominated, with mean molecular weight \${\textgreater}\$10. These atmospheres form during the planets' evolution from sub-Neptunes into rocky exoplanets. H\$\_2\$O that is made by reduction of iron oxides in the silicate magma is highly soluble in the magma, forming a dissolved reservoir that is protected from loss so long as the H\$\_2\$-dominated atmosphere persists. The large size of the dissolved reservoir buffers the H\$\_2\$O atmosphere against loss after the H\$\_2\$ has dispersed. Within our model, a long-lived, water-dominated atmosphere is a common outcome for efficient interaction between a nebula-derived atmosphere (peak atmosphere mass fraction 0.1-0.6 wt\%) and oxidized magma (\${\textgreater}\$5 wt\% FeO), followed by atmospheric loss. This idea predicts that most rocky planets that have orbital periods of 10-100 days and that have radii within 0.1-0.2 \$R\_\{Earth\}\$ of the lower edge of the radius valley still retain H\$\_2\$O atmospheres. This prediction is imminently testable with JWST and has implications for the interpretation of data for transiting super-Earths.},

	abstract = {The comb-like spectrum of a white light-illuminated Fabry-P{\textbackslash}'\{e\}rot etalon can serve as a cost-effective and stable reference for precise Doppler measurements. Understanding the stability of these devices across their broad (100's of nm) spectral bandwidths is essential to realize their full potential as Doppler calibrators. However, published descriptions remain limited to small bandwidths or short timespans. We present a \${\textbackslash}sim6\$ month broadband stability monitoring campaign of the Fabry-P{\textbackslash}'\{e\}rot etalon system deployed with the near-infrared Habitable Zone Planet Finder spectrograph (HPF). We monitor the wavelengths of each of \${\textbackslash}sim3500\$ resonant modes measured in HPF spectra of this Fabry-P{\textbackslash}'\{e\}rot etalon (free spectral range = 30 GHz, bandwidth = 820 - 1280 nanometers), leveraging the accuracy and precision of an electro-optic frequency comb reference. These results reveal chromatic structure in the Fabry-P{\textbackslash}'\{e\}rot mode locations and in their evolution with time. We measure an average drift on the order of 2 cm s \${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ d\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, with local departures up to \${\textbackslash}pm5\$ cm s \${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ d\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. We discuss these behaviors in the context of the Fabry-P{\textbackslash}'\{e\}rot etalon mirror dispersion and other optical properties of the system, and the implications for the use of similar systems for precise Doppler measurements. Our results show that this system supports the wavelength calibration of HPF at the \${\textbackslash}lesssim10\$ cm s \${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ level over a night and at the \${\textbackslash}lesssim30\$ cm s \${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ level over \${\textbackslash}sim10\$ d.

We pause both to reﬂect on decades of immense progress in the ﬁeld as well as to prepare for a new generation of large interferometers just now being commissioned (most notably, the CHARA, Keck and VLT Interferometers). First, this review summarizes the basic principles behind stellar interferometry needed by the lay-physicist and general astronomer to understand the scientiﬁc potential as well as technical challenges of interferometry. Next, the basic design principles of practical interferometers are discussed, using the experience of past and existing facilities to illustrate important points. Here there is signiﬁcant discussion of current trends in the ﬁeld, including the new facilities under construction and advanced technologies being debuted. This decade has seen the inﬂuence of stellar interferometry extend beyond classical regimes of stellar diameters and binary orbits to new areas such as mapping the accretion discs around young stars, novel calibration of the cepheid period-luminosity relation, and imaging of stellar surfaces. The third section is devoted to the major scientiﬁc results from interferometry, grouped into natural categories reﬂecting these current developments. Lastly, I consider the future of interferometry, highlighting the kinds of new science promised by the interferometers coming on-line in the next few years. I also discuss the longer-term future of optical interferometry, including the prospects for space interferometry and the possibilities of large-scale ground-based projects. Critical technological developments are still needed to make these projects attractive and affordable.},

	abstract = {This dissertation presents my study of Non-Redundant Aperture Masking Interferometry (or NRM) with Adaptive Optics, a technique for obtaining high-contrast infrared images at diffraction-limited resolution. I developed numerical, statistical, and on-telescope techniques for obtaining higher contrast, in order to build an imaging system capable of resolving massive Jupiter analogs in tight orbits around nearby stars. I used this technique, combined with Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics (LGSAO), to survey known brown dwarfs for brown dwarf and planetary companions. The diffraction-limited capabilities of this technique enable the detection of companions on short period orbits that make Keplerian mass measurement practical. This, in turn, provides mass and photometric measurements to test brown dwarf evolution (and atmosphere) models, which require empirical constraints to answer key questions and will form the basis for models of giant exoplanets for the next decade. I present the results of a close companion search around 16 known brown dwarf candidates (early L dwarfs) using the first application of NRM with LGSAO on the Palomar 200" Hale Telescope. The use of NRM allowed the detection of companions between 45-360 mas in Ks band, corresponding to projected physical separations of 0.6-10.0 AU for the targets of the survey. Due to unstable LGSAO correction, this survey was capable of detecting primary-secondary contrast ratios  down to [INCREMENT]Ks {\textasciitilde}1.5-2.5 (10:1), an order of magnitude brighter than if the system performed at specification. I present four candidate brown dwarf companions detected with moderate-to-high confidence (90\%-98\%), including two with projected physical separations less than 1.5 AU. A prevalence of brown dwarf binaries, if confirmed, may indicate that tight-separation binaries contribute to the total binary fraction more significantly than currently assumed, and make excellent candidates for dynamical mass measurement. For this project, I developed several new, robust tools to reject false positive detections, generate accurate contrast limits, and analyze NRM data in the low signal-to-noise regime. In order to increase the sensitivity of NRM, a critical and quantitative study of quasi-static wavefront errors needs to be undertaken. I investigated the impact of small-scale wavefront errors (those smaller than a sub-aperture) on NRM using a technique known as spatial filtering. Here, I explored the effects of spatial filtering through calculation, simulation, and observational tests conducted with an optimized pinhole and aperture mask in the PHARO instrument at the 200" Hale Telescope. I find that spatially filtered NRM can increase observation contrasts by 10-25\% on current AO systems and by a factor of 2-4 on higher-order AO systems. More importantly, this reveals that small scale wavefront errors contribute only modestly to the overall limitations of the NRM technique without very high-order AO systems, and that future efforts need focus on temporal stability and wavefront errors on the scale of the sub-aperture. I also develop a formalism for optimizing NRM observations with these AO systems and dedicated exoplanet imaging instruments, such as Project 1640 and the Gemini Planet Imager. This work provides a foundation for future NRM exoplanet experiments.},

also to more complex molecules like H2O even in highly

is a powerful tool that can be used for conducting an immediate census

	abstract = {Context. In recent years, ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy has 
become a powerful tool for investigating exoplanet atmospheres. It
allows the robust identification of molecular species, and it can be
applied to both transiting and non-transiting planets. Radial-velocity
measurements of the star HD 179949 indicate the presence of a giant
planet companion in a close-in orbit. The system is bright enough to be
an ideal target for near-infrared, high-resolution spectroscopy. 
Aims: Here we present the analysis of spectra of the system at 2.3
μm, obtained at a resolution of R {\textasciitilde} 100 000, during three nights of
observations with CRIRES at the VLT. We targeted the system while the
exoplanet was near superior conjunction, aiming to detect the planet's
thermal spectrum and the radial component of its orbital velocity. Methods: Unlike the telluric signal, the planet signal is subject to
a changing Doppler shift during the observations. This is due to the
changing radial component of the planet orbital velocity, which is on
the order of 100-150 km s-1 for these hot Jupiters. We can
therefore effectively remove the telluric absorption while preserving
the planet signal, which is then extracted from the data by cross
correlation with a range of model spectra for the planet atmosphere. Results: We detect molecular absorption from carbon monoxide and
water vapor with a combined signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 6.3, at a
projected planet orbital velocity of KP = (142.8 ±
3.4) km s-1, which translates into a planet mass of
MP = (0.98 ± 0.04) Jupiter masses, and an orbital
inclination of i = (67.7 ± 4.3) degrees, using the known stellar
radial velocity and stellar mass. The detection of absorption features
rather than emission means that, despite being highly irradiated, HD
179949 b does not have an atmospheric temperature inversion in the
probed range of pressures and temperatures. Since the host star is
active (R'HK {\textgreater} -4.9), this is in line with the
hypothesis that stellar activity damps the onset of thermal inversion
layers owing to UV flux photo-dissociating high-altitude, optical
absorbers. Finally, our analysis favors an oxygen-rich atmosphere for HD
179949 b, although a carbon-rich planet cannot be statistically ruled
out based on these data alone.

	title = {Détection de naines brunes et planètes géantes gazeuses à grande séparation utilisant des images d’archive},
	abstract = {Decades of astronomical data collection provided by dedicated instruments have led to a large amount of images taken at di erent wavelengths, resolutions and depths of ﬁeld that remain, for the most part, unexploited (eg 2MASS , WISE, SPITZER, SDSS). Developments of new data processing algorithms gives a new value to these images taken years earlier. This project aims at discovering new low-mass companions with large separations around young low-mass stars (M-type) using archive images. 2MASS J, H and Ks band images were used to identify the candidates. Seven candidates were identiﬁed using a combination of two algorithms that were applied on a judicious selection of 2 812 stars. The method combined a point spread function substraction algorithm based on a linear combination of reference stars and an algorithm inspired by di erential imaging. Five of them had already been identiﬁed by other teams. One was probably an M9 star from the ﬁeld and the other an L3—, potentially a member of the young association AB Doradus. This research conﬁrms, like others before, the low occurence rate of planetary mass and brown dwarf companions at large separations (Á 100 AU) around young low mass stars. This conclusion led us to develop of an alternative detection method sensitive to companions on short orbits ({\textless} 40 AU). This second project, partially completed, aims to demonstrate that it is possible to detect objects with planetary masses orbiting young sun-like stars (G–F–A) regardless of their separation. This is possible thanks to the new generation of high dispersion infrared spectrographs. Spectral processing applied on synthetic observations has conﬁrmed that one can detect objects with an object/star brightness ratio down to 10´5. Only 1h exposure time with an instrument like SPIROU is enough to detect companions with an atmosphere mainly composed of molecules. The spectral processing consists of cross-correlation and spectral subtraction algorithms inspired by methods used in di erential imaging.},

	abstract = {Context. Ground-based high-dispersion (R {\textasciitilde} 100 000) spectroscopy (HDS) 
is proving to be a powerful technique with which to characterize
extrasolar planets. The planet signal is distilled from the bright
starlight, combining ral and time-differential filtering techniques. In
parallel, high-contrast imaging (HCI) is developing rapidly, aimed at
spatially separating the planet from the star. While HDS is limited by
the overwhelming noise from the host star, HCI is limited by residual
quasi-static speckles. Both techniques currently reach planet-star
contrast limits down to {\textasciitilde}10-5, albeit for very different
types of planetary systems. Aims: In this work, we discuss a way
to combine HDS and HCI (HDS+HCI). For a planet located at a resolvable
angular distance from its host star, the starlight can be reduced up to
several orders of magnitude using adaptive optics and/or coronography.
In addition, the remaining starlight can be filtered out using
high-dispersion spectroscopy, utilizing the significantly different (or
Doppler shifted) high-dispersion spectra of the planet and star. In this
way, HDS+HCI can in principle reach contrast limits of {\textasciitilde}10-5
× 10-5, although in practice this will be limited by
photon noise and/or sky-background. In contrast to current direct
imaging techniques, such as Angular Differential Imaging and Spectral
Differential Imaging, it will work well at small working angles and is
much less sensitive to speckle noise. For the discovery of previously
unknown planets HDS+HCI requires a high-contrast adaptive optics system
combined with a high-dispersion R {\textasciitilde} 100 000 integral field spectrograph
(IFS). This combination currently does not exist, but is planned for the
European Extremely Large Telescope. Methods: We present
simulations of HDS+HCI observations with the E-ELT, both probing thermal
emission from a planet at infrared wavelengths, and starlight reflected
off a planet atmosphere at optical wavelengths. For the infrared
simulations we use the baseline parameters of the E-ELT and METIS
instrument, with the latter combining extreme adaptive optics with an R
= 100 000 IFS. We include realistic models of the adaptive optics
performance and atmospheric transmission and emission. For the optical
simulation we also assume R = 100 000 IFS with adaptive optics
capabilities at the E-ELT. Results: One night of HDS+HCI
observations with the E-ELT at 4.8 μm (Δλ = 0.07 μm)
can detect a planet orbiting α Cen A with a radius of R = 1.5
Rearth and a twin-Earth thermal spectrum of Teq =
300 K at a signal-to-noise (S/N) of 5. In the optical, with a Strehl
ratio performance of 0.3, reflected light from an Earth-size planet in
the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri can be detected at a S/N of 10 in
the same time frame. Recently, first HDS+HCI observations have shown the
potential of this technique by determining the spin-rotation of the
young massive exoplanet β Pictoris b. Conclusions: The
exploration of the planetary systems of our neighbor stars is of great
scientific and philosophical value. The HDS+HCI technique has the
potential to detect and characterize temperate rocky planets in their
habitable zones. Exoplanet scientists should not shy away from claiming
a significant fraction of the future ELTs to make such observations
possible.},

	abstract = {Aims: We explore the capabilities of CARMENES for characterising 
hot-Jupiter atmospheres by targeting multiple water bands, in
particular, those at 1.15 and 1.4 μm. Hubble Space Telescope
observations suggest that this wavelength region is relevant for
distinguishing between hazy and/or cloudy and clear atmospheres. 
Methods: We observed one transit of the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b with
CARMENES. Telluric and stellar absorption lines were removed using
SYSREM, which performs a principal component analysis including proper
error propagation. The residual spectra were analysed for water
absorption with cross-correlation techniques using synthetic atmospheric
absorption models. Results: We report a cross-correlation peak at
a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 6.6, revealing the presence of water in
the transmission spectrum of HD 189733 b. The absorption signal appeared
slightly blueshifted at -3.9 ± 1.3 km s-1. We measured
the individual cross-correlation signals of the water bands at 1.15 and
1.4 μm, finding cross-correlation peaks at S/N of 4.9 and 4.4,
respectively. The 1.4 μm feature is consistent with that observed
with the Hubble Space Telescope. Conclusions: The water bands
studied in this work have been mainly observed in a handful of planets
from space. Being able also to detect them individually from the ground
at higher spectral resolution can provide insightful information to
constrain the properties of exoplanet atmospheres. Although the current
multi-band detections can not yet constrain atmospheric haze models for
HD 189733 b, future observations at higher S/N could provide an
alternative way to achieve this aim.},

	abstract = {High-resolution Doppler spectroscopy provides a powerful means for chemical detections in exoplanetary atmospheres. This approach involves monitoring hundreds of molecular lines in the planetary spectrum Doppler shifted by the orbital motion of the planet. The molecules are detected by cross-correlating the observed spectrum of the system with a model planetary spectrum. The method has led to molecular detections of H2O, CO, and TiO in hot Jupiters using large ground-based telescopes. Critical to this method, however, is the accurate removal of the stellar and telluric features from the observed spectrum, also known as detrending. Previous molecular detections have relied on specific choices of detrending methods and parameters. However, the robustness of molecular detections across the different choices has not been investigated in detail. We conduct a systematic investigation of the effect of detrending algorithms, parameters, and optimizations on chemical detections using high-resolution spectroscopy. As a case study, we consider the hot Jupiter HD 189733b. Using multiple methods, we confirm high-significance detections of H2O (4.8σ) and CO (4.7σ). Additionally, we report evidence for HCN at high significance (5.0σ). On the other hand, our results highlight the need for improved metrics and extended observations for robust confirmations of such detections. In particular, we show that detection significances of ≳4σ can be obtained by optimizing detrending at incorrect locations in the planetary velocity space; such false-positives can occur in nearly 30 per cent of cases. We discuss approaches to help distinguish molecular detections from spurious noise.},

In this paper I discuss the recent history of kernel phase, in particular in the matrix-based study of sparse arrays, and propose an analogous generalization of the closure amplitude to kernel amplitudes. This new approach can self-calibrate throughput and scintillation errors in optical imaging, which extends the power of kernel phase-like methods to symmetric targets where amplitude and not phase calibration can be a significant limitation, and will enable further developments in high angular resolution astronomy.},

	abstract = {Context. The formation of planetary systems is a common, yet complex mechanism. Numerous stars have been identified to possess a debris disk, a proto-planetary disk or a planetary system. The understanding of such formation process requires the study of debris disks. These targets are substantial and particularly suitable for optical and infrared observations. Sparse aperture masking (SAM) is a high angular resolution technique strongly contributing to probing the region from 30 to 200 mas around the stars. This area is usually unreachable with classical imaging, and the technique also remains highly competitive compared to vortex coronagraphy. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We aim to study debris disks with aperture masking to probe the close environment of the stars. Our goal is either to find low-mass companions, or to set detection limits. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We observed eight stars presenting debris disks (β Pictoris, AU Microscopii, 49 Ceti, η Telescopii, Fomalhaut, g Lupi, HD 181327, and HR 8799) with SAM technique on the NaCo instrument at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: No close companions were detected using closure phase information under 0.5'' of separation from the parent stars. We obtained magnitude detection limits that we converted to Jupiter masses detection limits using theoretical isochrones from evolutionary models. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: We derived upper mass limits on the presence of companions in the area of a few times the telescope's diffraction limits around each target star. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) during runs 087.C-0450(A), 087.C-0450(B) 087.C-0750(A), 088.C-0358(A).All magnitude detection limits maps are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} ({\textless}A href="http://130.79.128.5"{\textgreater}http://130.79.128.5{\textless}/A{\textgreater}) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/595/A31"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/595/A31{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: Observational data on companion statistics around young stellar systems is needed to flesh out the formation pathways for extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs. Aperture masking is a new technique that is able to address an important part of this discovery space. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We observed the two debris disk systems HD 92945 and HD 141569 with sparse aperture masking (SAM), a new mode offered on the NaCo instrument at the VLT. A search for faint companions was performed using a detection strategy based on the analysis of closure phases recovered from interferograms recorded on the Conica camera. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Our results demonstrate that SAM is a very competitive mode in the field of companion detection. We obtained 5σ high-contrast detection limits at λ/D of 2.5 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} (ΔL' = 6.5) for HD 92945 and 4.6 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} (ΔL' = 5.8) for HD 141569. According to brown dwarf evolutionary models, our data impose an upper mass boundary for any companion for the two stars to, respectively, 18 and 22 Jupiter masses at minimum separations of 1.5 and 7 AU. The detection limits is mostly independent of angular separation, until reaching the diffraction limit of the telescope. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: We have placed upper limits on the existence of companions to our target systems that fall close to the planetary mass regime. This demonstrates the potential for SAM mode to contribute to studies of faint companions. We furthermore show that the final dynamic range obtained is directly proportional to the error on the closure phase measurement. At the present performance levels of 0.28 degree closure phase error, SAM is among the most competitive techniques for recovering companions at scales of one to several times the diffraction limit of the telescope. Further improvements to the detection threshold can be expected with more accurate phase calibration. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) during runs 084.C-755 (A) and 085.C-277 (A).},

We pause both to reflect on decades of immense progress in the field as well as to prepare for a new generation of large interferometers just now being commissioned (most notably, the CHARA, Keck and VLT Interferometers). First, this review summarizes the basic principles behind stellar interferometry needed by the lay-physicist and general astronomer to understand the scientific potential as well as technical challenges of interferometry. Next, the basic design principles of practical interferometers are discussed, using the experience of past and existing facilities to illustrate important points. Here there is significant discussion of current trends in the field, including the new facilities under construction and advanced technologies being debuted. This decade has seen the influence of stellar interferometry extend beyond classical regimes of stellar diameters and binary orbits to new areas such as mapping the accretion discs around young stars, novel calibration of the cepheid period-luminosity relation, and imaging of stellar surfaces. The third section is devoted to the major scientific results from interferometry, grouped into natural categories reflecting these current developments. Lastly, I consider the future of interferometry, highlighting the kinds of new science promised by the interferometers coming on-line in the next few years. I also discuss the longer-term future of optical interferometry, including the prospects for space interferometry and the possibilities of large-scale ground-based projects. Critical technological developments are still needed to make these projects attractive and affordable.},

	abstract = {L'étude des exoplanètes est un domaine très actif. Malgré la nature indirecte de la plupart des détections, celles-ci nous fournissent déjà une quantité importante d'informations sur les propriétés de ces systèmes exoplanétaires: leur masse, taille et paramètres orbitaux. Pourtant, la détection directe de la lumière qu'elles émettent ou réfléchissent fournit des informations encore plus précieuses. Les instruments coronographiques conçus dans ce but sont généralement limités par la qualité de front d'onde, qui les empêchent notamment d'atteindre leurs performances théoriques. A l'inverse les techniques employant des observables qui sont robustes à ces aberrations sont limitées par le bruit de photon. Ces deux approches sont rendues incompatibles par la rupture de la relation de convolution qui lie l'objet à l'image. Les travaux décrits dans cette thèse explorent différentes avenues visant à contourner cette incompatibilité afin de combiner les performances des méthodes coronographiques et interférométriques, grâce à des transferts technologiques et au développement de nouvelles méthodes: Le développement des kernels différentiels angulaires (ADK) qui utilisent les principes de l'imagerie différentielle angulaire (ADI) dans le cadre des noyaux de phases et clôtures de phases. L'expérimentation de noyaux de phases avec une pupille apodisée. L'exploitation des noyaux de phases à partir d'images saturées. Le développement d'architectures exploitant les noyaux d'obscurité (kernel nulling) pour un nombre arbitraire de pupille, et notamment pour des architectures à grandes lignes de base. Ces travaux poussent les performances en contraste des observables robustes à faible séparation, et entament l'exploration des nouvelles voies du haut contraste robuste.},

Imaging detections are challenging because of the combined effect of small angular separation and large luminosity contrast between a planet and its host star. High-contrast observations with the Keck and Gemini telescopes have revealed three planets orbiting the star HR 8799, with projected separations of 24, 38, and 68 astronomical units. Multi-epoch data show counter clockwise orbital motion for all three imaged planets. The low luminosity of the companions and the estimated age of the system imply planetary masses between 5 and 13 times that of Jupiter. This system resembles a scaled-up version of the outer portion of our solar system.},

Here, we present optical observations of an exoplanet candidate, Fomalhaut b. Fomalhaut b lies about 119 astronomical units (AU) from the star and 18 AU of the dust belt, matching predictions of its location. Hubble Space Telescope observations separated by 1.73 years reveal counterclockwise orbital motion. Dynamical models of the interaction between the planet and the belt indicate that the planet’s mass is at most three times that of Jupiter; a higher mass would lead to gravitational disruption of the belt, matching predictions of its location. The flux detected at 0.8 μm is also consistent with that of a planet with mass no greater than a few times that of Jupiter. The brightness at 0.6 μm and the lack of detection at longer wavelengths suggest that the detected flux may include starlight reflected off a circumplanetary disk, with dimension comparable to the orbits of the Galilean satellites. We also observe variability of unknown origin at 0.6 μm.},

	abstract = {Every philosophy has holes, and it is the responsibility of proponents of a philosophy to point out these problems. Here are a few holes in Bayesian data analysis: (1) the usual rules of conditional probability fail in the quantum realm, (2) flat or weak priors lead to terrible inferences about things we care about, (3) subjective priors are incoherent, (4) Bayesian decision picks the wrong model, (5) Bayes factors fail in the presence of flat or weak priors, (6) for Cantorian reasons we need to check our models, but this destroys the coherence of Bayesian inference. Some of the problems of Bayesian statistics arise from people trying to do things they should not be trying to do, but other holes are not so easily patched. In particular, it may be a good idea to avoid flat, weak, or conventional priors, but such advice, if followed, would go against the vast majority of Bayesian practice and requires us to confront the fundamental incoherence of Bayesian inference. This does not mean that we think Bayesian inference is a bad idea, but it does mean that there is a tension between Bayesian logic and Bayesian workflow which we believe can only be resolved by considering Bayesian logic as a tool, a way of revealing inevitable misfits and incoherences in our model assumptions, rather than as an end in itself.},

	abstract = {We present a spectrum of the cool (Teff = 900 K) brown dwarf Gliese 229B. This spectrum, with a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio per spectral resolution element ({\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}30), spans the wavelength range from 0.837 μm to 5.0 μm. We identify a total of four different major methane absorption features, including the fundamental band at 3.3 μm, at least four steam bands, and two neutral cesium features. We confirm the recent detection of carbon monoxide (CO) in excess of what is predicted by thermochemical equilibrium calculations. Carbon is primarily involved in a chemical balance between methane and CO at the temperatures and pressures present in the outer parts of a brown dwarf. At lower temperatures, the balance favors methane, while in the deeper, hotter regions, the reaction reverses to convert methane into CO. The presence of CO in the observable part of the atmosphere is therefore a sensitive indicator of vertical flows. The high signal-to-noise ratio in the 1 μm to 2.5 μm region permits us to place constraints on the quantity of dust in the atmosphere of the brown dwarf. We are unable to reconcile the observed spectrum with synthetic spectra that include the presences of dust. The presence of CO but lack of dust may be a clue to the location of the boundaries of the outer convective region of the atmosphere: The lack of dust may mean that it is not being conveyed into the photosphere by convection, or that it exists in patchy clouds. If the dust is not in clouds, but rather sits below the outer convective region, we estimate that the boundary between outer convective and inner radiative layers is between 1250 K and 1600 K, in agreement with recent models.},

Using the 305-m Arecibo radiotelescope to make precise timing measurements of pulses from the recently discovered 6.2-ms pulsar PSR1257 +12 (ref. 2), we demonstrate that, rather than being associated with a stellar object, the pulsar is orbited by two or more planet-sized bodies. The planets detected so far have masses of at least 2.8 M⊕ and 3.4 M⊕ where M⊕ is the mass of the Earth. Their respective distances from the pulsar are 0.47 AU and 0.36 AU, and they move in almost circular orbits with periods of 98.2 and 66.6 days. Observations indicate that at least one more planet may be present in this system. The detection of a planetary system around a nearby ({\textasciitilde}500 pc), old neutron star, together with the recent report on a planetary companion to the pulsar PSR1829-10 (ref. 3) raises the tantalizing possibility that a non-negligible fraction of neutron stars observable as radio pulsars may be orbited by planet-like bodies.},

	abstract = {AU Mic is a young (\${\textbackslash}sim\$24 Myr), pre-Main Sequence M{\textasciitilde}dwarf star that was observed in the first month of science observations of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and re-observed two years later. This target has photometric variability from a variety of sources that is readily apparent in the TESS light curves; spots induce modulation in the light curve, flares are present throughout (manifesting as sharp rises with slow exponential decay phases), and transits of AU Mic b may be seen by eye as dips in the light curve. We present a combined analysis of both TESS Sector 1 and Sector 27 AU Mic light curves including the new 20-second cadence data from TESS Year 3. We compare flare rates between both observations and analyze the spot evolution, showing that the activity levels increase slightly from Sector 1 to Sector 27. Furthermore, the 20-second data collection allows us to detect more flares, smaller flares, and better resolve flare morphology in white light as compared to the 2-minute data collection mode. We also refine the parameters for AU Mic b by fitting three additional transits of AU Mic b from Sector 27 using a model that includes stellar activity. We show that the transits exhibit clear transit timing variations (TTVs) with an amplitude of \${\textbackslash}sim\$80 seconds. We also detect three transits of a 2.8 \$R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ planet, AU Mic c, which has a period of 18.86 days.},

The discovery was based on the proper motion analysis of two datasets spanning 15 months. However, the second dataset suffered from bad atmospheric conditions, which limited the significance of the re-detection at the 3σ level. In this Letter, we report new VLT/NaCo observations of HD 95086 obtained on 2013 June 26 and 27 at L' to recover the planet candidate. We unambiguously re-detect the companion HD 95086 b with multiple independent pipelines at a signal-to-noise ratio greater than or equal to 5. Combined with previously reported measurements, our astrometry decisively shows that the planet is comoving with HD 95086 and inconsistent with a background object. With a revised mass of 5 ± 2 Jupiter masses, estimated from its L' photometry and "hot-start" models at 17 ± 4 Myr, HD 95086 b becomes a new benchmark for further physical and orbital characterization of young giant planets.

	abstract = {Direct imaging has only begun to inventory the population of gas giant planets on wide orbits around young stars in the solar neighborhood. Following this approach, we carried out a deep imaging survey in the near-infrared using VLT/NaCo to search for substellar companions. Here we report the discovery of a probable companion orbiting the young (10-17 Myr), dusty, early-type (A8) star HD 95086 at 56 AU in L' (3.8 μm) images. This discovery is based on observations with more than a year time lapse. Our first epoch clearly revealed the source at {\textasciitilde}= 10σ, while our second epoch lacks good observing conditions, yielding a {\textasciitilde}= 3σ detection. Various tests were thus made to rule out possible artifacts. This recovery is consistent with the signal at the first epoch but requires cleaner confirmation. Nevertheless, our astrometric precision suggests that the companion is comoving with the star with a 3σ confidence level. The planetary nature of the source is reinforced by a non-detection in the Ks-band (2.18 μm) images according to its possible extremely red Ks-L' color. Conversely, background contamination is rejected with good confidence level. The luminosity yields a predicted mass of about 4-5 M Jup (at 10-17 Myr) using "hot-start" evolutionary models, making HD 95086 b the exoplanet with the lowest mass ever imaged around a star.

If the orbital velocity of the planet could be determined, the masses of both star and planet could be calculated using Newton's law of gravity, just as in the case of stellar double-line eclipsing binaries. Here we report high-dispersion ground-based spectroscopy of a transit of the extrasolar planet HD209458b. We see a significant wavelength shift in absorption lines from carbon monoxide in the planet's atmosphere, which we conclude arises from a change in the radial component of the planet's orbital velocity. The masses of the star and planet are 1.00+/-0.22MSun and 0.64+/-0.09MJup respectively. A blueshift of the carbon monoxide signal of approximately 2kms-1 with respect to the systemic velocity of the host star suggests the presence of a strong wind flowing from the irradiated dayside to the non-irradiated nightside of the planet within the 0.01-0.1mbar atmospheric pressure range probed by these observations. The strength of the carbon monoxide signal suggests a carbon monoxide mixing ratio of (1-3)×10-3 in this planet's upper atmosphere.},

It is one of the brightest exoplanets and one of the nearest to us, with an orbital period of just a few days. Over the course of more than a decade, measurements of its orbital inclination have been announced and refuted, and have hitherto remained elusive. Here we report the detection of carbon monoxide absorption in the thermal dayside spectrum of τ Boötis b. At a spectral resolution of {\textasciitilde}100,000, we trace the change in the radial velocity of the planet over a large range in phase, determining an orbital inclination of 44.5° +/- 1.5° and a mass 5.95 +/- 0.28 times that of Jupiter, demonstrating that atmospheric characterization is possible for non-transiting planets. The strong absorption signal points to an atmosphere with a temperature that is decreasing towards higher altitudes, in contrast to the temperature inversion inferred for other highly irradiated planets. This supports the hypothesis that the absorbing compounds believed to cause such atmospheric inversions are destroyed in τ Boötis b by the ultraviolet emission from the active host star.},

A small but significant position angle change is detected at constant separation; the orbital motion is confirmed with literature measurements. Efficient Monte Carlo techniques place preliminary constraints on the orbital parameters of HD 95086 b. With 68\% confidence, a semimajor axis of \{61.7\}-8.4+20.7 au and an inclination of 153{\textbackslash}fdg \{0\}-13.5+9.7 are favored, with eccentricity less than 0.21. Under the assumption of a coplanar planet-disk system, the periastron of HD 95086 b is beyond 51 au with 68\% confidence. Therefore, HD 95086 b cannot carve the entire gap inferred from the measured infrared excess in the SED of HD 95086. We use our sensitivity to additional planets to discuss specific scenarios presented in the literature to explain the geometry of the debris belts. We suggest that either two planets on moderately eccentric orbits or three to four planets with inhomogeneous masses and orbital properties are possible. The sensitivity to additional planetary companions within the observations presented in this study can be used to help further constrain future dynamical simulations of the planet-disk system.},

	abstract = {Current and future high contrast imaging instruments aim to detect exoplanets at closer orbital separations, lower masses, and/or older ages than their predecessors, with the eventual goal of directly detecting terrestrial-mass habitable-zone exoplanets. However, continually evolving speckles in the coronagraphic science image still limit state-of-the-art ground-based exoplanet imaging instruments to contrasts at least two orders of magnitude worse than what is needed to achieve this goal. For ground-based adaptive optics (AO) instruments it remains challenging for most speckle suppression techniques to attenuate both the dynamic atmospheric and quasi-static instrumental speckles. We have proposed a focal plane wavefront sensing and control algorithm to address this challenge, called the Fast Atmospheric Self-coherent camera (SCC) Technique (FAST), which enables the SCC to operate down to millisecond timescales even when only a few photons are detected per speckle. Here we present preliminary experimental results of FAST on the Santa Cruz Extreme AO Laboratory (SEAL) testbed. In particular, we illustrate the benefit "second stage" AO-based focal plane wavefront control, demonstrating FAST closed-loop compensation of evolving residual atmospheric turbulence on millisecond-timescales.},

	abstract = {Spectroscopic studies of planets outside of our own solar system provide some of the most crucial information about their formation, evolution, and atmospheric properties. In ground-based spectroscopy, the process of extracting the planet's signal from the stellar and telluric signal has proven to be the most difficult barrier to accurate atmospheric information. However, with novel normalization and smoothing methods, this barrier can be minimized and the detection significance dramatically increased over existing methods. In this paper, we take two examples of CRIRES emission spectroscopy taken of HD 209458 b and HD 179949 b and apply SPORK (SPectral cOntinuum Refinement for telluriKs) and iterative smoothing to boost the detection significance from 5.78 to 9.71 sigma and from 4.19 sigma to 5.90 sigma, respectively. These methods, which largely address systematic quirks introduced by imperfect detectors or reduction pipelines, can be employed in a wide variety of scenarios, from archival data sets to simulations of future spectrographs.},

	abstract = {Giant exoplanets orbiting very close to their parent star (hot Jupiters) are subject to tidal forces expected to synchronize their rotational and orbital periods on short timescales (tidal locking). However, spin rotation has never been measured directly for hot Jupiters. Furthermore, their atmospheres can show equatorial super-rotation via strong eastward jet streams, and/or high-altitude winds flowing from the day- to the night-side hemisphere. Planet rotation and atmospheric circulation broaden and distort the planet spectral lines to an extent that is detectable with measurements at high spectral resolution. We observed a transit of the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b around 2.3 μm and at a spectral resolution of R∼105 with CRIRES at the ESO Very Large Telescope. After correcting for the stellar absorption lines and their distortion during transit (the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect), we detect the absorption of carbon monoxide and water vapor in the planet transmission spectrum by cross-correlating with model spectra. The signal is maximized (7.6σ) for a planet rotational velocity of km s−1, corresponding to a rotational period of days. This is consistent with the planet orbital period of 2.2 days, and therefore with tidal locking. We find that the rotation of HD 189733 b is longer than 1 day (3σ). The data only marginally (1.5σ) prefer models with rotation versus models without rotation. We measure a small day- to night-side wind speed of km s−1. Compared to the recent detection of sodium blueshifted by km s−1, this likely implies a strong vertical wind shear between the pressures probed by near-infrared and optical transmission spectroscopy.},

	abstract = {High-resolution spectroscopy has opened the way for new, detailed study of exoplanet atmospheres. There is evidence that this technique can be sensitive to the complex, three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric structure of these planets. In this work, we perform cross-correlation analysis of high-resolution (R ∼ 100,000) CRIRES/VLT emission spectra of the hot Jupiter HD 209458b. We generate template emission spectra from a 3D atmospheric circulation model of the planet, accounting for temperature structure and atmospheric motions—winds and planetary rotation—missed by spectra calculated from one-dimensional models. In this first-of-its-kind analysis, we find that using template spectra generated from a 3D model produces a more significant detection (6.9σ) of the planet's signal than any of the hundreds of one-dimensional models we tested (maximum of 5.1σ). We recover the planet's thermal emission, its orbital motion, and the presence of CO in its atmosphere at high significance. Additionally, we analyzed the relative influences of 3D temperature and chemical structures in this improved detection, including the contributions from CO and H2O, as well as the role of atmospheric Doppler signatures from winds and rotation. This work shows that the hot Jupiter's 3D atmospheric structure has a first-order influence on its emission spectra at high resolution and motivates the use of multidimensional atmospheric models in high-resolution spectral analysis.},

	abstract = {In experiments where one searches a large parameter space for an anomaly, one often finds many spurious noise-induced peaks in the likelihood. This is known as the look-elsewhere effect, and must be corrected for when performing statistical analysis. This paper introduces a method to calibrate the false alarm probability (FAP), or \$p\$-value, for a given dataset by considering the heights of the highest peaks in the likelihood. In the simplest form of self-calibration, the look-elsewhere-corrected \${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2\$ of a physical peak is approximated by the \${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2\$ of the peak minus the \${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2\$ of the highest noise-induced peak. Generalizing this concept to consider lower peaks provides a fast method to quantify the statistical significance with improved accuracy. In contrast to alternative methods, this approach has negligible computational cost as peaks in the likelihood are a byproduct of every peak-search analysis. We apply to examples from astronomy, including planet detection, periodograms, and cosmology.},

	abstract = {We present interferometric angular diameter measurements of 21 low-mass, K- and M-dwarfs made with the CHARA Array. This sample is enhanced by adding a collection of radius measurements published in the literature to form a total data set of 33 K–M-dwarfs with diameters measured to better than 5\%. We use these data in combination with the Hipparcos parallax and new measurements of the star's bolometric flux to compute absolute luminosities, linear radii, and effective temperatures for the stars. We develop empirical relations for ∼K0 to M4 main-sequence stars that link the stellar temperature, radius, and luminosity to the observed (B − V), (V − R), (V − I), (V − J), (V − H), and (V − K) broadband color index and stellar metallicity [Fe/H]. These relations are valid for metallicities ranging from [Fe/H] = −0.5 to +0.1 dex and are accurate to ∼2\%, ∼5\%, and ∼4\% for temperature, radius, and luminosity, respectively. Our results show that it is necessary to use metallicity-dependent transformations in order to properly convert colors into stellar temperatures, radii, and luminosities. Alternatively, we find no sensitivity to metallicity on relations we construct to the global properties of a star omitting color information, e.g., temperature–radius and temperature–luminosity. Thus, we are able to empirically quantify to what order the star's observed color index is impacted by the stellar iron abundance. In addition to the empirical relations, we also provide a representative look-up table via stellar spectral classifications using this collection of data. Robust examinations of single star temperatures and radii compared to evolutionary model predictions on the luminosity–temperature and luminosity–radius planes reveal that models overestimate the temperatures of stars with surface temperatures {\textless}5000 K by ∼3\%, and underestimate the radii of stars with radii {\textless}0.7 R☉ by ∼5\%. These conclusions additionally suggest that the models over account for the effects that the stellar metallicity may have on the astrophysical properties of an object. By comparing the interferometrically measured radii for the single star population to those of eclipsing binaries, we find that for a given mass, single and binary star radii are indistinguishable. However, we also find that for a given radius, the literature temperatures for binary stars are systematically lower compared to our interferometrically derived temperatures of single stars by ∼200 to 300 K. The nature of this offset is dependent on the validation of binary star temperatures, where bringing all measurements to a uniform and correctly calibrated temperature scale is needed to identify any influence stellar activity may have on the physical properties of a star. Lastly, we present an empirically determined H-R diagram using fundamental properties presented here in combination with those in Boyajian et al. for a total of 74 nearby, main-sequence, A- to M-type stars, and define regions of habitability for the potential existence of sub-stellar mass companions in each system.},

	abstract = {Context. Due to their low transit probability, the long-period planets are, as a population, only partially probed by transit surveys. Radial velocity surveys thus have a key role to play, in particular for giant planets. Cold Jupiters induce a typical radial velocity semi-amplitude of 10m.s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}, which is well within the reach of multiple instruments that have now been in operation for more than a decade. Aims. We take advantage of the ongoing radial velocity survey with the sophie high-resolution spectrograph, which continues the search started by its predecessor elodie to further characterize the cold Jupiter population. Methods. Analyzing the radial velocity data from six bright solar-like stars taken over a period of up to 15 years, we attempt the detection and confirmation of Keplerian signals. Results. We announce the discovery of six planets, one per system, with minimum masses in the range 2.99-8.3 Mjup and orbital periods between 200 days and 10 years. The data do not provide enough evidence to support the presence of additional planets in any of these systems. The analysis of stellar activity indicators confirms the planetary nature of the detected signals. Conclusions. These six planets belong to the cold and massive Jupiter population, and four of them populate its eccentric tail. In this respect, HD 80869 b stands out as having one of the most eccentric orbits, with an eccentricity of 0.862{\textasciicircum}\{+0.028\}\_\{-0.018\}. These planets can thus help to better constrain the migration and evolution processes at play in the gas giant population. Furthermore, recent works presenting the correlation between small planets and cold Jupiters indicate that these systems are good candidates to search for small inner planets.},

	abstract = {The CARMENES exoplanet survey of M dwarfs has obtained more than 18 000 spectra of 329 nearby M dwarfs over the past five years as part of its guaranteed time observations (GTO) program. We determine planet occurrence rates with the 71 stars from the GTO program for which we have more than 50 observations. We use injection-and-retrieval experiments on the radial-velocity (RV) time series to measure detection probabilities. We include 27 planets in 21 planetary systems in our analysis. We find 0.06+0.04-0.03 giant planets (100 M\_Earth {\textless} M\_pl sin i {\textless} 1000 M\_Earth) per star in periods of up to 1000 d, but due to a selection bias this number could be up to a factor of five lower in the whole 329-star sample. The upper limit for hot Jupiters (orbital period of less than 10 d) is 0.03 planets per star, while the occurrence rate of planets with intermediate masses (10 M\_Earth {\textless} M\_pl sin i {\textless} 100 M\_Earth) is 0.18+0.07-0.05 planets per star. Less massive planets with 1 M\_Earth {\textless} M\_pl sin i {\textless} 10 M\_Earth are very abundant, with an estimated rate of 1.32+0.33-0.31 planets per star for periods of up to 100 d. When considering only late M dwarfs with masses M\_star {\textless} 0.34 M\_sol, planets more massive than 10 M\_Earth become rare. Instead, low-mass planets with periods shorter than 10 d are significantly overabundant. For orbital periods shorter than 100 d, our results confirm the known stellar mass dependences from the Kepler survey: M dwarfs host fewer giant planets and at least two times more planets with M\_pl sin i {\textless} 10 M\_Earth than G-type stars. In contrast to previous results, planets around our sample of very low-mass stars have a higher occurrence rate in short-period orbits of less than 10 d. Our results demonstrate the need to take into account host star masses in planet formation models.},

	abstract = {Context. High contrast imaging enables the determination of orbital parameters for substellar companions (planets, brown dwarfs) from the observed relative astrometry and the estimation of model and age-dependent masses from their observed magnitudes or spectra. Combining astrometric positions with radial velocity gives direct constraints on the orbit and on the dynamical masses of companions. A brown dwarf was discovered with the VLT/SPHERE instrument at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in 2017, which orbits at ˜11 au around HD 206893. Its mass was estimated between 12 and 50 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} from evolutionary models and its photometry. However, given the significant uncertainty on the age of the system and the peculiar spectrophotometric properties of the companion, this mass is not well constrained. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We aim at constraining the orbit and dynamical mass of HD 206893 B. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We combined radial velocity data obtained with HARPS spectra and astrometric data obtained with the high contrast imaging VLT/SPHERE and VLT/NaCo instruments, with a time baseline less than three years. We then combined those data with astrometry data obtained by HIPPARCOS and Gaia with a time baseline of 24 yr. We used a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to estimate the orbital parameters and dynamical mass of the brown dwarf from those data. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We infer a period between 21 and 33 yr and an inclination in the range 20-41° from pole-on from HD 206893 B relative astrometry. The RV data show a significant RV drift over 1.6 yr. We show that HD 206893 B cannot be the source of this observed RV drift as it would lead to a dynamical mass inconsistent with its photometry and spectra and with HIPPARCOS and Gaia data. An additional inner (semimajor axis in the range 1.4-2.6 au) and massive (˜15 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) companion is needed to explain the RV drift, which is compatible with the available astrometric data of the star, as well as with the VLT/SPHERE and VLT/NaCo nondetection. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}HARPS run 089.C-0739(A), 192.C-0224(C), 099.C-0205(A), 098.C-0739(A) and 1101.C-0557(A); SPHERE run 096.C-0388, 097.C-0865(D) and 099.C-0708(A); Gaia DR2.},

	abstract = {Based on optical high-resolution spectra obtained with CFHT/ESPaDOnS, we present new measurements of activity and magnetic field proxies of 442 low-mass K5-M7 dwarfs. The objects were analysed as potential targets to search for planetary-mass companions with the new spectropolarimeter and high-precision velocimeter, SPIRou. We have analysed their high-resolution spectra in an homogeneous way: circular polarization, chromospheric features and Zeeman broadening of the FeH infrared line. The complex relationship between these activity indicators is analysed; while no strong connection is found between the large-scale and small-scale magnetic fields, the latter relates with the non-thermal flux originating in the chromosphere. We then examine the relationship between various activity diagnostics and the optical radial-velocity (RV) jitter available in the literature, especially for planet host stars. We use this to derive for all stars an activity merit function (higher for quieter stars) with the goal of identifying the most favourable stars, where the RV jitter is low enough for planet searches. We find that the main contributors to the RV jitter are the large-scale magnetic field and the chromospheric non-thermal emission. In addition, three stars (GJ 1289, GJ 793 and GJ 251) have been followed along their rotation using the spectropolarimetric mode, and we derive their magnetic topology. These very slow rotators are good representatives of future SPIRou targets. They are compared to other stars, where the magnetic topology is also known. The poloidal component of the magnetic field is predominent in all three stars.},

In the framework of the preparation of the SPIRou Input Catalogue (SPIC), the CoolSnap program aims at screening M dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood against binarity, rapid rotation, activity, etc. To optimize the selection, this paper describes the methods used to compute effective temperature, metallicity, projected rotation velocity of a large sample of 440 M dwarfs observed in the visible with the high-resolution spectropolarimeter Echelle SpectroPolArimetric Device for the ObservatioN of Stars (ESPaDOnS) at Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope. It also summarizes known and newly discovered spectroscopic binaries, and stars known to belong to visual multiple systems. A calibration of the projected rotation velocity versus measured line widths for M dwarfs observed by the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter is derived, and the resulting values are compared to equatorial rotation velocities deduced from rotation periods and radii. A comparison of the derived effective temperatures and metallicities with literature values is also conducted. Finally, the radial-velocity uncertainty of each star in the sample is estimated, to narrow down the selection of stars to be included into the SPIC.},

Previous efforts have estimated the probability of this happening between 3 and 5 billion years in the future using a large number of direct numerical simulations with an N-body code, but were not able to obtain accurate estimates before 3 billion years in the future because Mercury instability events are too rare. In this paper we use a new rare event sampling technique, Quantile Diffusion Monte Carlo (QDMC), to obtain accurate estimates of the probability of a Mercury instability event between 2 and 3 billion years in the future in the REBOUND N-body code. We show that QDMC provides unbiased probability estimates at a computational cost of up to 100 times less than direct numerical simulation. QDMC is easy to implement and could be applied to many problems in planetary dynamics in which it is necessary to estimate the probability of a rare event.},

We fit atmospheric models for giant planets and brown dwarfs and perform spectral retrievals with petitRADTRANS and ATMO on the observed GRAVITY, SPHERE, and GPI spectra of HD 206893 B. To recover its unusual spectral features, we include additional extinction by high-altitude dust clouds made of enstatite grains in the atmospheric model fits. We also infer the orbital parameters of HD 206893 B by combining the \${\textbackslash}sim 100{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mu{\textbackslash}text\{as\}\$ precision astrometry from GRAVITY with data from the literature and constrain the mass and position of HD 206893 C based on the Gaia proper motion anomaly of the system. The extremely red color and the very shallow \$1.4{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mu{\textbackslash}text\{m\}\$ water absorption feature of HD 206893 B can be fit well with the adapted atmospheric models and spectral retrievals. Altogether, our analysis suggests an age of \${\textbackslash}sim 3\$-\$300{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}text\{Myr\}\$ and a mass of \${\textbackslash}sim 5\$-\$30{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}text\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}text\{Jup\}\$ for HD 206893 B, which is consistent with previous estimates but extends the parameter space to younger and lower-mass objects. The GRAVITY astrometry points to an eccentric orbit (\$e = 0.29{\textasciicircum}\{+0.06\}\_\{-0.11\}\$) with a mutual inclination of \${\textless} 34.4{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}text\{deg\}\$ with respect to the debris disk of the system. While HD 206893 B could in principle be a planetary-mass companion, this possibility hinges on the unknown influence of the inner companion on the mass estimate of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{+5\}\_\{-4\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}text\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}text\{Jup\}\$ from radial velocity and Gaia as well as a relatively small but significant Argus moving group membership probability of \${\textbackslash}sim 61{\textbackslash}\%\$. However, we find that if the mass of HD 206893 B is \${\textless} 30{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}text\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}text\{Jup\}\$, then the inner companion HD 206893 C should have a mass between \${\textbackslash}sim 8\$-\$15{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}text\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}text\{Jup\}\$.},

We measure rotation periods in the range 0.5–190 d, with the distribution peaking at ∼30 d. We revise the stellar masses and radii for our sample of rotators by exploiting the Gaia DR2 data. For ∼20 per cent of the sample, we compare the photometric rotation periods with those derived from different spectroscopic indicators, ﬁnding good correspondence in most cases. We compare our rotation periods distribution to the one obtained by the Kepler survey in the same mass range, and to that derived by the MEarth survey for stars in the mass range 0.07–0.25 M . The APACHE and Kepler periods distributions are in good agreement, conﬁrming the reliability of our results, while the APACHE distribution is consistent with the MEarth result only for the older/slow rotators, and in the overlapping mass range of the two surveys. Combining the APACHE/Kepler distribution with the MEarth distribution, we highlight that the rotation period increases with decreasing stellar mass, in agreement with previous work. Our ﬁndings also suggest that the spin-down time scale, from fast to slow rotators, changes crossing the fully convective limit at ≈0.3 M for M dwarfs. The catalogue of 107 rotating M dwarfs presented here is particularly timely, as the stars are prime targets for the potential identiﬁcation of transiting small planets with TESS and amenable to high-precision mass determination and further atmospheric characterization measurements.},

	abstract = {Searches for periodicity in time series are often done with models of 
periodic signals, whose statistical significance is assessed via false
alarm probabilities or Bayes factors. However, a statistically
significant periodic model might not originate from a strictly periodic
source. In astronomy in particular, one expects transient signals that
show periodicity for a certain amount of time before vanishing. This
situation is encountered for instance in the search for planets in
radial velocity data. While planetary signals are expected to have a
stable phase, amplitude and frequency - except when strong planet-planet
interactions are present - signals induced by stellar activity will
typically not exhibit the same stability. In the present article, we
explore the use of periodic functions multiplied by time windows to
diagnose whether an apparently periodic signal is truly so. We suggest
diagnostics to check whether a signal is consistently present in the
time series, and has a stable phase, amplitude and period. The tests are
expressed both in a periodogram and Bayesian framework. Our methods are
applied to the Solar HARPS-N data as well as HD 215152, HD 69830 and HD
13808. We find that (i) the HARPS-N Solar data exhibits signals at the
Solar rotation period and its first harmonic (\${\textbackslash}sim\$ 13.4 days). The
frequency and phase of the 13.4 days signal appear constant within the
estimation uncertainties, but its amplitude presents significant
variations which can be mapped to activity levels. (ii) as previously
reported, we find four, three and two planets orbiting HD 215152, HD
69830 and HD 13808.},

The host star (TIC 158588995, \$V = 14.2\$ mag, \$J = 10.3\$ mag) is characterized by its M2V spectral type with \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}star=0.420{\textbackslash}pm 0.010\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{R\}\_{\textbackslash}star = 0.420{\textbackslash}pm 0.013\$ R\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, and \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{T\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{eff\}\} = 3514{\textbackslash}pm 57\$ K, and is located at a distance \$d=46.16 {\textbackslash}pm 0.03\$ pc. Combining the available transit light curves plus radial velocity measurements and jointly fitting a circular orbit model, we find an orbital period of \$1.977143 {\textbackslash}pm 3{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-6\}\$ days, a planetary radius of \$5.25 {\textbackslash}pm 0.17\$ \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{R\}\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$, and a mass of \$23.6 {\textbackslash}pm 3.3\$ \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ implying a mean density of
\${\textbackslash}rho\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{p\} = 0.91 {\textbackslash}pm 0.15\$ [g cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$]. A non-circular orbit model fit delivers similar planetary mass and radius values within the uncertainties. Given the measured planetary radius and mass, TOI-674b is one of the largest and most massive super-Neptune class planets
discovered around an M type star to date. It is also a resident of the so-called Neptunian desert and a promising candidate for atmospheric characterisation using the James Webb Space Telescope.},

	abstract = {The relationship between mass and radius (M-R relation) is the key for 
inferring the planetary compositions and thus valuable for the studies
of formation and migration models. However, the M-R relation alone is
not enough for planetary characterization due to the dependence of it on
other confounding variables. This paper provides a non-trivial extension
of the M-R relation by including the incident flux as an additional
variable. By using Bayesian hierarchical modeling (BHM) that leverages
the flexibility of finite mixture models, a probabilistic
mass-radius-flux relationship (M-R-F relation) is obtained based on a
sample of 319 exoplanets. We find that the flux has nonnegligible impact
on the M-R relation, while such impact is strongest for hot-Jupiters. On
the population level, the planets with higher level of flux tend to be
denser, and high flux could trigger significant mass loss for plants
with radii larger than \$13R\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$. As a result, failing to account
for the flux in mass prediction would cause systematic over or
under-estimation. With the recent advent of computing power, although a
lot of complex statistical models can be fitted using Monte Carlo
methods, it has largely remain illusive how to validate these complex
models when the data are observed with large measurement errors. We
present two novel methods to examine model assumptions, which can be
used not only for the models we present in this paper but can also be
adapted for other statistical models.},

the Roman Coronagraph Instrument (CGI) will serve as a pathfinder for
key technologies needed for future Earth-finding missions. The Roman
Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge (Roman EIDC) was a community engagement
effort that tasked participants with extracting exoplanets and their
orbits for a 47 UMa-like target star, given: (1) 15 years of simulated
precursor radial velocity (RV) data, and (2) six epochs of simulated
imaging taken over the course of the Roman mission. The Roman EIDC
simulated images include 4 epochs with CGI's Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph
(HLC) plus 2 epochs with a starshade (SS) assumed to arrive as part of a
Starshade Rendezvous later in the mission. Here, we focus on our
in-house analysis of the outermost planet, for which the starshade's
higher throughput and lower noise floor present a factor of {\textasciitilde}4
improvement in signal-to-noise ratio over the narrow-field HLC. We find
that, although the RV detection was marginal, the precursor RV data
enable the mass and orbit to be constrained with only 2 epochs of
starshade imaging. Including the HLC images in the analysis results in
improved measurements over RV + SS alone, with the greatest gains
resulting from images taken at epochs near maximum elongation. Combining
the two epochs of SS imaging with the RV + HLC data resulted in a factor
of {\textasciitilde}2 better orbit and mass determinations over RV + HLC alone. The
Roman CGI, combined with precursor RV data and later mission SS imaging,
form a powerful trifecta in detecting exoplanets and determining their
masses, albedos, and system configurations. While the Roman CGI will
break new scientific and technological ground with direct imaging of
giant exoplanets within {\textasciitilde}5 AU of V{\textasciitilde}5 and brighter stars, a Roman
Starshade Rendezvous mission would additionally enable the detection of
planets out to {\textasciitilde}8 AU in those systems.},

An open source code, exojax, developed in this study, was written in
Python using the GPU/TPU compatible package for automatic
differentiation and accelerated linear algebra, JAX (Bradbury et al.
2018). We validated the model by comparing it with existing opacity
calculators and a radiative transfer code and found reasonable
agreements of the output. As a demonstration, we analyzed the
high-dispersion spectrum of a nearby brown dwarf, Luhman 16 A and found
that a model including water, carbon monoxide, and \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{H\_2/He\}\$
collision induced absorption was well fitted to the observed spectrum
(\$R=10{\textasciicircum}5\$ and \$2.28-2.30 {\textbackslash}mu{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\$). As a result, we found that
\$T\_0 = 1295 {\textbackslash}pm 14 {\textbackslash}mathrm\{K\}\$ at 1 bar and \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{C/O\} = 0.62 {\textbackslash}pm

demonstrates the potential of full Bayesian analysis of brown dwarfs and

	abstract = {Stellar activity poses one of the main obstacles for the detection and 
characterisation of small exoplanets around cool stars, as it can induce
radial velocity (RV) signals that can hide or mimic the presence of
planetary companions. Several indicators of stellar activity are
routinely used to identify activity-related signals in RVs, but not all
indicators trace exactly the same activity effects, nor are any of them
always effective in all stars. We evaluate the performance of a set of
spectroscopic activity indicators for M dwarf stars with different
masses and activity levels with the aim of finding a relation between
the indicators and stellar properties. In a sample of 98 M dwarfs
observed with CARMENES, we analyse the temporal behaviour of RVs and
nine spectroscopic activity indicators: cross-correlation function (CCF)
full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM), contrast, and bisector inverse slope
(BIS), chromatic index (CRX), differential line width (dLW), and indices
of the chromospheric lines H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and calcium infrared triplet. A
total of 56 stars of the initial sample show periodic signals related to
activity in at least one of these ten parameters. RV is the parameter
for which most of the targets show an activity-related signal. CRX and
BIS are effective activity tracers for the most active stars in the
sample, especially stars with a relatively high mass, while for less
active stars, chromospheric lines perform best. FWHM and dLW show a
similar behaviour in all mass and activity regimes, with the highest
number of activity detections in the low-mass, high-activity regime.
Most of the targets for which we cannot identify any activity-related
signals are stars at the low-mass end of the sample. These low-mass
stars also show the lowest RV scatter, which indicates that ultracool M
dwarfs could be better candidates for planet searches than earlier
types, which show larger RV jitter.},

mechanisms is to constrain the occurrence rate of these peculiar

limitation when studying newly born stars is stellar activity. This
cocktail of phenomena triggered by fast rotation, strong magnetic fields
and complex internal dynamics, especially present in very young stars,
compromises our ability to detect exoplanets. In this paper, we
investigated the limitations of such detections in the context of
already acquired data solely using radial velocity data acquired with a
non-stabilised spectrograph. We employed two strategies: Doppler Imaging
and Gaussian Processes and could confidently detect Hot Jupiters with
semi-amplitude of 100 \$m.s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ buried in the stellar activity. We also
showed the advantages of the Gaussian Process approach in this case.

stellar kinematic groups, we estimate their ages to be older than about
700 Ma. The two planets around G 264-012 were discovered using only
radial-velocity (RV) data from the CARMENES exoplanet survey, with
estimated orbital periods of \$2.30\$ d and \$8.05\$ d, respectively.
Photometric monitoring and analysis of activity indicators reveal a
third signal present in the RV measurements, at about 100 d, caused by
stellar rotation. The planet Gl 393 b was discovered in the RV data from
the HARPS, CARMENES, and HIRES instruments. Its identification was only
possible after modelling, with a Gaussian process (GP), the variability
produced by the magnetic activity of the star. For the earliest
observations, this variability produced a forest of peaks in the
periodogram of the RVs at around the 34 d rotation period determined
from \{{\textbackslash}em Kepler\} data, which disappeared in the latest epochs. After
correcting for them with this GP model, a significant signal showed at a
period of \$7.03\$ d. No significant signals in any of our spectral
activity indicators or contemporaneous photometry were found at any of
the planetary periods. Given the orbital and stellar properties, the
equilibrium temperatures of the three planets are all higher than that
for Earth. Current planet formation theories suggest that these two
systems represent a common type of architecture. This is consistent with
formation following the core accretion paradigm.},

We present results from a search for substellar and planetary-mass
companions to a sample of 12 ultracool T8-Y0 field brown dwarfs with the
Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3. We find no evidence for
resolved binary companions among our sample down to separations of
0.7-2.5 au. Combining our survey with prior searches, we place some of
the first statistically robust constraints to date on the multiplicity
properties of the coolest, lowest mass brown dwarfs in the field.
Accounting for observational biases and incompleteness, we derive a
binary frequency of f = 5.5{\textasciicircum}\{+5.2\}\_\{-3.3\} per cent for T5-Y0 brown
dwarfs at separations of 1.5-1000 au, for an overall binary fraction of
ftot = 8 ± 6 per cent. Modelling the projected
separation as a lognormal distribution, we find a peak in separation at
ρ \_0 = 2.9{\textasciicircum}\{+0.8\}\_\{-1.4\} au with a logarithmic width of σ =
0.21{\textasciicircum}\{+0.14\}\_\{-0.08\}. We infer a mass ratio distribution peaking
strongly towards unity, with a power-law index of γ =
6.1{\textasciicircum}\{+4.0\}\_\{-2.7\}, reinforcing the significance of the detection of a
tighter and higher mass ratio companion population around lower mass
primaries. These results are consistent with prior studies and support
the idea of a decreasing binary frequency with spectral type in the
Galactic field.},

aberrations in the pupil plane (speckles) can mimic the signal of a
companion at small angular separations. Kernel phase, which is a
generalization of closure phase (known from sparse aperture masking), is
independent of pupil plane phase noise to second order and allows for a
robust calibration of full pupil, extreme adaptive optics observations.
We applied kernel phase combined with a principal component based
calibration process to a suitable but not optimal, high cadence, pupil
stabilized L'-band (3.8 \{μ m\}) data set from the ESO archive. We
detect eight low-mass companions, five of which were previously unknown,
and two have angular separations of ∼0.8-1.2 λ/D (i.e.
∼80-110 mas), demonstrating that kernel phase achieves a resolution
below the classical diffraction limit of a telescope. While we reach a
5σ contrast limit of ∼1/100 at such angular separations, we
demonstrate that an optimized observing strategy with more diversity of
PSF references (e.g. star-hopping sequences) would have led to a better
calibration and even better performance. As such, kernel phase is a
promising technique for achieving the best possible resolution with
future space-based telescopes (e.g. James Webb Space Telescope), which
are limited by the mirror size rather than atmospheric turbulence, and
with a dedicated calibration process also for extreme adaptive optics
facilities from the ground.},

	abstract = {The accumulation of aberrations along the optical path in a telescope produces distortions and speckles in the resulting images, limiting the performance of cameras at high angular resolution. It is important to achieve the highest possible sensitivity to faint sources, using both hardware and data analysis software. While analytic methods are
efficient, real systems are better modeled numerically, but numerical models of complicated optical systems with many parameters can be hard to understand, optimize, and apply. Automatic differentiation or "backpropagation" software developed for machine-learning applications now makes calculating derivatives with respect to aberrations in arbitrary planes straightforward for any optical system. We apply this powerful new tool to the problem of high-angular-resolution astronomical imaging. Self-calibrating observables such as the "closure phase" or "bispectrum" have been widely used in optical and radio astronomy to mitigate optical aberrations and achieve high-fidelity imagery. Kernel phases are a generalization of closure phases valid in the limit of small phase errors. Using automatic differentiation, we reproduce existing kernel phase theory within this framework and demonstrate an extension to the case of a Lyot coronagraph, which is found to have self-calibrating combinations of speckles. which are resistant to phase noise, but only in the very high-wave-front-quality regime. As an illustrative example, we reanalyze Palomar adaptive optics observations of the binary α Ophiuchi, finding consistency between the new
pipeline and the existing standard. We present a new Python package MORPHINE that incorporates these ideas, with an interface similar to the popular package POPPY, for optical simulation with automatic
differentiation. These methods may be useful for designing improved astronomical optical systems by gradient descent.},

We have applied a novel high angular resolution data analysis technique based on the extraction and fitting of kernel phases to archival data. This was found to deliver a dramatic
improvement over earlier analysis methods, permitting a search for companions down to projected separations of {\textasciitilde}1 AU on NIC1 snapshot images. We reveal five new close binary candidates and present revised astrometry on previously known binaries, all of which were recovered with the technique. The new candidate binaries have sufficiently close separation to determine dynamical masses in a short-term observing campaign. We also present four marginal detections of objects which may be very close binaries or high-contrast companions. Including only confident detections within 19 pc, we report a binary fraction of at least {\textbackslash}epsilon \_b = 17.2{\textasciicircum}\{+5.7\}\_\{-3.7\} \%. The results reported here provide new insights into the population of nearby ultracool binaries, while also offering an incisive case study of the benefits conferred by the kernel phase approach in the recovery of companions within a few resolution elements of the point-spread function core.

self-calibration properties of interferometric observable quantities. The friendly notion of closure phase, which is key to the recent observational successes of non-redundant aperture masking interferometry used with adaptive optics, appears to be one example of a wide family of observable quantities that are not contaminated by phase noise. In the high-Strehl regime, soon to be available thanks to the coming generation of extreme adaptive optics systems on ground-based telescopes, and already available from space, closure phase like information can be extracted from any direct image, even taken with a redundant aperture. These new phase-noise immune observable quantities, called kernel phases, are determined a priori from the knowledge of the geometry of the pupil only. Re-analysis of archive data acquired with the Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS instrument using this new kernel-phase algorithm demonstrates the power of the method as it clearly detects and locates with milliarcsecond precision a known companion to a star at angular separation less than the diffraction limit.},

	abstract = {Context. In exoplanet searches with radial velocity data, the most 
common statistical significance metrics are the Bayes factor and the
false alarm probability (FAP). Both have proved useful, but do not
directly address whether an exoplanet detection should be claimed.
Furthermore, it is unclear which detection threshold should be taken and
how robust the detections are to model misspecification. Aims. The
present work aims at defining a detection criterion which conveys as
precisely as possible the information needed to claim an exoplanet
detection. We compare this new criterion to existing ones in terms of
sensitivity and robustness. Methods. We define a significance metric
called the false inclusion probability (FIP) based on the posterior
probability of presence of a planet. Posterior distributions are
computed with the nested sampling package Polychord. We show that for
FIP and Bayes factor calculations, defining priors on linear parameters
as Gaussian mixture models allows to significantly speed up
computations. The performances of the FAP, Bayes factor and FIP are
studied with simulations as well as analytical arguments. We compare the
methods assuming the model is correct, then evaluate their sensitivity
to the prior and likelihood choices. Results. Among other properties,
the FIP offers ways to test the reliability of the significance levels,
it is particularly efficient to account for aliasing and allows to
exclude the presence of planets with a certain confidence. We find that,
in our simulations, the FIP outperforms existing detection metrics. We
show that planet detections are sensitive to priors on period and
semi-amplitude and that letting free the noise parameters offers better
performances than fixing a noise model based on a fit to ancillary
indicators.},

of the code allows the users to generate atmospheric 1D parametric
models of the temperature, abundances (in thermochemical equilibrium or

custom resolving power and line-wing cutoff values; compute emission or
transmission spectra considering cross sections from molecular line
transitions, collision-induced absorption, Rayleigh scattering, gray
clouds, and alkali resonance lines; and perform Markov chain Monte Carlo
atmospheric retrievals for a given transit or eclipse dataset. We
benchmarked the pyratbay framework by reproducing line-by-line
cross-section sampling of ExoMol cross sections, producing transmission
and emission spectra consistent with petitRADTRANS models, accurately
retrieving the atmospheric properties of simulated transmission and
emission observations generated with TauREx models, and closely
reproducing Aura retrieval analyses of the space-based transmission
spectrum of HD 209458b. Finally, we present a retrieval analysis of a
population of transiting exoplanets, focusing on those observed in
transmission with the HST WFC3/G141 grism. We found that this instrument
alone can confidently identify when a dataset shows H2O-absorption
features; however, it cannot distinguish whether a muted H2O feature is
caused by clouds, high atmospheric metallicity, or low H2O abundance.
Our results are consistent with previous retrieval analyses. The

	abstract = {Thermal phase variations of short period planets indicate that they are not spherical cows: day-to-night temperature contrasts range from hundreds to thousands of degrees, rivaling their vertical temperature contrasts. Nonetheless, the emergent spectra of short-period planets have typically been fit using one-dimensional (1D) spectral retrieval codes that only account for vertical temperature gradients. The
popularity of 1D spectral retrieval codes is easy to understand: they are robust and have a rich legacy in Solar System atmospheric studies. Exoplanet researchers have recently introduced multi-dimensional retrieval schemes for interpreting the spectra of short-period planets, but these codes are necessarily more complex and computationally expensive than their 1D counterparts. In this paper we present an alternative: phase-dependent spectral observations are inverted to produce longitudinally resolved spectra that can then be fitted using standard 1D spectral retrieval codes. We test this scheme on the iconic phase-resolved spectra of WASP-43b and on simulated JWST observations using the open-source pyratbay 1D spectral retrieval framework. Notably, we take the model complexity of the simulations one step further over previous studies by allowing for longitudinal variations in composition in addition to temperature. We show that performing 1D spectral
retrieval on longitudinally resolved spectra is more accurate than applying 1D spectral retrieval codes to disk-integrated emission spectra, despite being identical in terms of computational load. We find that for the extant Hubble and Spitzer observations of WASP-43b the difference between the two approaches is negligible but that JWST phase measurements should be treated with longitudinally {\textbackslash}textbf\{re\}solved {\textbackslash}textbf\{spect\}ral retrieval (ReSpect).},

	abstract = {We present a large forward-modeling analysis for 55 late-T (T7-T9) dwarfs, using low-resolution (\$R{\textbackslash}approx150\$) near-infrared spectra and cloudless Sonora-Bobcat model atmospheres. We derive the objects' effective temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities, radii, masses, and luminosities using our newly developed Bayesian framework, and use the resulting population properties to test the model atmospheres. We find (1) our objects' fitted metallicities are 0.3-0.4 dex lower than those of nearby stars; (2) their ages derived from spectroscopic parameters are implausibly young; (3) their fitted temperatures show a similar spread as empirical temperature scales at a given spectral type but are \${\textbackslash}sim100\$ K hotter for \${\textbackslash}geqslant\$T8 dwarfs; and (4) their spectroscopically inferred masses are unphysically small. These results suggest the Sonora-Bobcat assumptions of cloudless and chemical-equilibrium atmospheres do not adequately reproduce late-T dwarf spectra. We also find a gravity- and a metallicity-dependence of temperatures. Combining the resulting parameter posteriors of our sample, we quantify the degeneracy between surface gravity and metallicity such that an increase in \$Z\$ combined with a \$3.4{\textbackslash}times\$ increase in \${\textbackslash}log\{g\}\$ results in a spectrum that has similar fitted parameters. We note the systematic difference between our 1.0-2.5 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m spectra and the Sonora-Bobcat models is \${\textbackslash}approx\$2-4\% of the objects' peak \$J\$-band fluxes, implying modeling systematics will exceed measurement uncertainties when analyzing data with \$J\$-band S/N \${\textbackslash}gtrsim50\$. Using our large sample, we examine the fitting residuals as a function of wavelength and atmospheric properties to discern how to improve the models.

	abstract = {The direct detection of exoplanets with high-contrast instruments can be boosted with high spectral resolution. For integral field spectrographs yielding hyperspectral data, this means that the field of view consists of diffracted starlight spectra and a spatially localized planet. Analysis usually relies on cross-correlation with theoretical spectra. In a purely blind-search context, this supervised strategy can be biased with model mismatch and/or be computationally inefficient. Using an approach that is inspired by the remote-sensing community, we aim to propose an alternative to cross-correlation that is fully data-driven, which decomposes the data into a set of individual spectra and their corresponding spatial distributions. This strategy is called spectral unmixing. We used an orthogonal subspace projection to identify the most distinct spectra in the field of view. Their spatial distribution maps were then obtained by inverting the data. These spectra were then used to break the original hyperspectral images into their corresponding spatial distribution maps via non-negative least squares. The
performance of our method was evaluated and compared with a
cross-correlation using simulated hyperspectral data with medium resolution from the ELT/HARMONI integral field spectrograph. We show that spectral unmixing effectively leads to a planet detection solely based on spectral dissimilarities at significantly reduced computational cost. The extracted spectrum holds significant signatures of the planet while being not perfectly separated from residual starlight. The sensitivity of the supervised cross-correlation is three to four times higher than with unsupervised spectral unmixing, the gap is biased toward the former because the injected and correlated spectrum match perfectly. The algorithm was furthermore vetted on real data obtained with VLT/SINFONI of the beta Pictoris system.},

	abstract = {Previous work concerning planet formation around low-mass stars has 
often been limited to large planets and individual systems. As current
surveys routinely detect planets down to terrestrial size in these
systems, a more holistic approach that reflects their diverse
architectures is timely. Here, we investigate planet formation around
low-mass stars and identify differences in the statistical distribution
of planets. We compare the synthetic planet populations to observed
exoplanets. We used the Generation III Bern model of planet formation
and evolution to calculate synthetic populations varying the central
star from solar-like stars to ultra-late M dwarfs. This model includes
planetary migration, N-body interactions between embryos, accretion of
planetesimals and gas, and long-term contraction and loss of the gaseous
atmospheres. We find that temperate, Earth-sized planets are most
frequent around early M dwarfs and more rare for solar-type stars and
late M dwarfs. The planetary mass distribution does not linearly scale
with the disk mass. The reason is the emergence of giant planets for
M*{\textgreater}0.5 Msol, which leads to the ejection of smaller planets. For
M*{\textgreater}0.3 Msol there is sufficient mass in the majority of systems to
form Earth-like planets, leading to a similar amount of Exo-Earths going
from M to G dwarfs. In contrast, the number of super-Earths and larger
planets increases monotonically with stellar mass. We further identify a
regime of disk parameters that reproduces observed M-dwarf systems such
as TRAPPIST-1. However, giant planets around late M dwarfs such as GJ
3512b only form when type I migration is substantially reduced. We
quantify the stellar mass dependence of multi-planet systems using
global simulations of planet formation and evolution. The results
compare well to current observational data and predicts trends that can
be tested with future observations.},

Information from a detected transiting planet can be combined with a
population model to make predictions about the presence and properties

distribution of planetary systems (He et al. 2020; arXiv:2007.14473), we
compute the conditional occurrence of planets as a function of the
period and radius of Kepler--detectable planets. About half (\$0.52 {\textbackslash}pm
0.03\$) of the time, the detected planet is not the planet with the
largest semi-amplitude \$K\$ in the system, so efforts to measure the mass
of the transiting planet with RV follow-up will have to contend with
additional planetary signals in the data. We simulate RV observations to
show that assuming a single--planet model to measure the \$K\$ of the
transiting planet often requires significantly more observations than in
the ideal case with no additional planets, due to the systematic errors
from unseen planet companions. Our results show that planets around
10-day periods with \$K\$ close to the single--measurement RV precision
(\${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{1,{\textbackslash}rm obs\}\$) typically require \${\textbackslash}sim 100\$ observations to

Based on the combined analysis of TESS transit photometry and high precision radial velocity measurements we estimate a planetary mass of 13.8 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 1.0 M\$\_\{Earth\}\$ and radius of 3.03 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.15 R\$\_\{Earth\}\$, implying a bulk density of 2.73 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.47 \${\textbackslash}textrm\{g cm\}{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$. TOI-220 \$b\$ orbits a relative bright (V=10.4) and old (10.1\${\textbackslash}pm\$1.4 Gyr) K dwarf star with a period of \${\textbackslash}sim\$10.69 d. Thus, TOI-220 \$b\$ is a new warm sub-Neptune with very precise mass and radius determinations. A Bayesian analysis of the TOI-220 \$b\$ internal structure indicates that due to the strong irradiation it receives, the low density of this planet could be explained with a steam atmosphere in radiative-convective equilibrium and a supercritical water layer on top of a differentiated interior made of a silicate mantle and a small iron core.},

This test was used to augment our algorithmic pipeline for transit lightcurves analysis. It was applied to \$1598\$ amateur and professional transit observations of \$26\$ targets being monitored in the EXPANSION project. We detected \$109\$ statistically significant candidate events revealing a roughly \$2:1\$ asymmetry in favor of spots-crossings over faculae-crossings. Although some candidate anomalies likely appear non-physical and originate from systematic errors, such asymmetry between negative and positive events should indicate a physical difference between the frequency of star spots and faculae. Detected spot-crossing events also reveal positive correlation between their amplitude and width, possibly owed to spot size correlation. However, the frequency of all detectable crossing events appears just about a few per cent, so they cannot explain excessive transit timing noise observed for several targets.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01101},
	abstract = {Mass-independent isotopic anomalies of carbonaceous and non-carbonaceous meteorites show a clear dichotomy suggesting an efficient separation of the inner and outer solar system. Observations show that ring-like structures in the distribution of mm-sized pebbles in protoplanetary disks are common. These structures are often associated with drifting pebbles being trapped by local pressure maxima in the gas disk. Similar structures may also have existed in the sun's natal disk, which could naturally explain the meteorite/planetary isotopic dichotomy. Here, we test the effects of a strong pressure bump in the outer disk (e.g. \${\textbackslash}sim\$5{\textasciitilde}au) on the formation of the inner solar system. We model dust coagulation and evolution, planetesimal formation, as well as embryo's growth via planetesimal and pebble accretion. Our results show that terrestrial embryos formed via planetesimal accretion rather than pebble accretion. In our model, the radial drift of pebbles foster planetesimal formation. However, once a pressure bump forms, pebbles in the inner disk are lost via drift before they can be efficiently accreted by embryos growing at \${\textbackslash}gtrapprox\$1{\textasciitilde}au. Embryos inside \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.5-1.0au grow relatively faster and can accrete pebbles more efficiently. However, these same embryos grow to larger masses so they should migrate inwards substantially, which is inconsistent with the current solar system. Therefore, terrestrial planets most likely accreted from giant impacts of Moon to roughly Mars-mass planetary embryos formed around \${\textbackslash}gtrapprox\$1.0{\textasciitilde}au. Finally, our simulations produce a steep radial mass distribution of planetesimals in the terrestrial region which is qualitatively aligned with formation models suggesting that the asteroid belt was born low-mass.},

The planet candidate has a mass similar to our own planet, and it is orbiting Proxima Centauri, a red dwarf in the Alpha Centauri triple system which is also the closest system to the Sun. Proxima b was detected using the radial velocity technique (also known as the Doppler method). Although the technology has been available for almost two decades, improvements in calibration of the instruments and developments of the data-analysis techniques employed were necessary to achieve this goal. In this chapter we first review the basic properties of the star, and we put in context the discovery of the planet in terms of what is known about exoplanet populations around red dwarfs. We also give an overall description of the process and efforts that led to its detection in an historical context. While space-transit photometry has proven to be the most effective method to obtain large statistically significant samples of exoplanets, the requirement of almost perfect alignment of the orbit with the line of sight makes it unlikely that the nearest planets can be detected using this technique. As a result, the radial velocity technique remains the most sensitive one in terms of finding very nearby planets due to its lower sensitivity to the inclination of the orbit. The detection of very nearby planets enables new follow-up opportunities to characterize planetary systems and their environment, ranging from future attempts for direct imaging, characterization of their high-energy radiation environments, and the study of extended structures such as debris disks or asteroid belts. These very nearby planets promise the first chances of characterizing the atmospheres of planets similar to our own and should enable the search for evidence for life beyond the solar system within the next decade.},

If this is a general model for life, then life must require (i) a source of energy, with which to build and sustain molecular complexity and information processing; (ii) elemental raw materials, from which to construct molecules having specific properties and reactivity; (iii) a solvent that supports the synthesis of the full range of molecules required by life and properly mediates the full range of necessary interactions among those molecules; and (iv) physicochemical conditions in which life’s molecules can be synthesized, are appropriately stable, and can interact as needed for lifelike function. For life on Earth, these general requirements, respectively, take the specific form: (i) light energy in visible-to-near-infrared wavelengths or chemical energy as provided by oxidation–reduction disequilibrium, (ii) the “biogenic” elements (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur) (iii) liquid water, and (iv) specific ranges in temperature, pH, salinity, pressure, and other environmental factors.

There is actually circumstantial evidence that most planetary systems become unstable after the disappearance of gas from the protoplanetary disk. These instabilities can be due to the original system being too crowded and too closely packed or to external perturbations such as tides, planetesimal scattering, or torques from distant stellar companions. The Solar System was not exceptional in this sense. In its inner part, a crowded system of planetary embryos became unstable, leading to a series of mutual impacts that built the terrestrial planets on a timescale of ∼100 My. In its outer part, the giant planets became temporarily unstable, and their orbital configuration expanded under the effect of mutual encounters. A planet might have been ejected in this phase. Thus, the orbital distributions of planetary systems that we observe today, both solar and extrasolar ones, can be different from those emerging from the formation process, and it is important to consider possible long-term evolutionary effects to connect the two.},

	abstract = {Most exoplanets are expected to be embedded in the flows of plasmas and the magnetic fields of their host stars. This setup enables powerful electromagnetic coupling mechanisms if the exoplanets are sufficiently close to their host stars. The coupling can result in large electromagnetic energy fluxes between the exoplanets and the stars possibly generating luminous effects on the stars. The root cause of the electromagnetic interaction and the resulting coupling is the relative motion of the exoplanet with respect to the magnetized plasma of the host star. Due to the large diversity of the exoplanets, e.g., distance to star, size, and the diversity of the host stars, e.g., stellar classes, the nature and the energy fluxes in the star planet interaction are expected to exhibit huge quantitative and qualitative variability. In this chapter, we introduce the basic setup of this coupling and the underlying physical mechanisms. We discuss various models of the electromagnetic coupling, such as the Alfvén wing model or models which describe the release of magnetic stresses, e.g., in coronal magnetic fields. We also briefly review the existing observational evidence for the star planet coupling and put it in context with theoretical expectations. We also compare the star planet coupling with the well-studied electromagnetic coupling between planets and moons in the outer solar system, e.g., Jupiter and its moon Io.},

	abstract = {One of the most exciting developments in the field of exoplanets has been the progression from “stamp-collecting” to demography, from discovery to characterization, from exoplanets to comparative exoplanetology. There is an exhilaration when a prediction is confirmed, a trend is observed, or a new population appears. This transition has been driven by the rise in the sheer number of known exoplanets, which has been rising exponentially for two decades (Mamajek, Cumulative number of exoplanets discoveries versus time. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4057704.v1, 2016). However, the careful collection, scrutiny, and organization of these exoplanets are necessary for drawing robust, scientific conclusions that are sensitive to the biases and caveats that have gone into their discovery. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss and demonstrate important considerations to keep in mind when examining or constructing a catalog of exoplanets. First, we introduce the value of exoplanetary catalogs. There are a handful of large, online databases that aggregate the available exoplanet literature and render it digestible and navigable – an ever more complex task with the growing number and diversity of exoplanet discoveries. We compare and contrast three of the most up-to-date general catalogs, including the data and tools that are available. We then describe exoplanet catalogs that were constructed to address specific science questions or exoplanet discovery space. Although we do not attempt to list or summarize all the published lists of exoplanets in the literature in this chapter, we explore the case study of the NASA Kepler mission planet catalogs in some detail. Finally, we lay out some of the best practices to adopt when constructing or utilizing an exoplanetcatalog.},

	abstract = {Astronomers have discovered that both planets and binaries are abundant throughout the Galaxy. In combination, we know of over 100 planets in binary and higher-order multi-star systems, in both circumbinary and circumstellar configurations. In this chapter, we review these findings and some of their implications for the formation of both stars and planets. Most of the planets found have been circumstellar, where there is seemingly a ruinous influence of the second star if sufficiently close ({\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}lesssim {\textbackslash})50 AU). Hosts of hot Jupiters have been a particularly popular target for binary star studies, showing an enhanced rate of stellar multiplicity for moderately wide binaries (beyond ≳100 AU). This was thought to be a sign of Kozai-Lidov migration; however recent studies have shown this mechanism to be too inefficient to account for the majority of hot Jupiters. A couple of dozen circumbinary planets have been proposed around both main sequence and evolved binaries. Around main sequence binaries, there are preliminary indications that the frequency of gas giants is as high as those around single stars. There is however a conspicuous absence of circumbinary planets around the tightest main sequence binaries with periods of just a few days, suggesting a unique, more disruptive formation history of such close stellar pairs.},

Most of their volumes are occupied by hydrogen and helium, the primary constituents of the protostellar disks from which they formed. Significantly, the solar system giants are also highly enriched in heavier elements relative to the Sun, indicating that solid material participated in their assembly. Giant planets account for most of the mass of our planetary system and of those extrasolar planetary systems in which they are present. Therefore, giant planets are primary actors in determining the orbital architectures of planetary systems and, possibly, in affecting the composition of terrestrial planets. This chapter describes the principal route that, according to current knowledge, can lead to the formation of giant planets, the core nucleated accretion model, and an alternative route, the disk instability model, which may lead to the formation of planetary-mass objects on wide orbits.},

The atmospheric properties include the chemical compositions, temperature profiles, clouds/hazes, and energy circulation. These properties, in turn, can provide key insights into the atmospheric physicochemical processes of exoplanets as well as their formation mechanisms. Major advancements in atmospheric retrieval have been made in the last decade, thanks to a combination of state-of-the-art spectroscopic observations and advanced atmospheric modeling and statistical inference methods. These developments have already resulted in key constraints on the atmospheric H2O abundances, temperature profiles, and other properties for several exoplanets. Upcoming facilities such as the JWST will further advance this area. The present chapter is a pedagogical review of this exciting frontier of exoplanetary science. The principles of atmospheric retrievals of exoplanets are discussed in detail, including parametric models and statistical inference methods, along with a review of key results in the field. Some of the main challenges in retrievals with current observations are discussed along with new directions and the future landscape.},

	abstract = {The past decade has seen major progress in our understanding of terrestrial planet formation. Yet key questions remain. In this review we first address the growth of 100 km-scale planetesimals as a consequence of dust coagulation and concentration, with current models favoring the streaming instability. Planetesimals grow into Mars-sized (or larger) planetary embryos by a combination of pebble and planetesimal accretion. Models for the final assembly of the inner Solar System must match constraints related to the terrestrial planets and asteroids including their orbital and compositional distributions and inferred growth timescales. Two current models – the Grand Tack and low-mass (or empty) primordial asteroid belt scenarios – can each match the empirical constraints, but both have key uncertainties that require further study. We present formation models for close-in super-Earths – the closest current analogs to our own terrestrial planets despite their very different formation histories – and for terrestrial exoplanets in gas giant systems. We explain why super-Earth systems cannot form in situ but rather may be the result of inward gas-driven migration followed by the disruption of compact resonant chains. The Solar System is unlikely to have harbored an early system of super-Earths; rather, Jupiter’s early formation may have blocked the ice giants’ inward migration. Finally, we present a chain of events that may explain why our Solar System looks different than more than 99\% of exoplanet systems.},

With photometry and spectroscopy of these planets in hand from new extreme coronagraphic instruments such as SPHERE at VLT and GPI at Gemini, we are beginning to characterize and classify the atmospheres of these objects. Initially, it was assumed that young planets would be similar to field brown dwarfs, more massive objects that nonetheless share similar effective temperatures and compositions. Surprisingly, young planets appear considerably redder than field brown dwarfs, likely a result of their low surface gravities and indicating much different atmospheric structures. Preliminarily, young free-floating planets appear to be as or more variable than field brown dwarfs, due to rotational modulation of inhomogeneous surface features. Eventually, such inhomogeneity will allow the top of atmosphere structure of these objects to be mapped via Doppler imaging on extremely large telescopes. Direct imaging spectroscopy of giant exoplanets now is a prelude for the study of habitable zone planets. Eventual direct imaging spectroscopy of a large sample of habitable zone planets with future telescopes such as LUVOIR will be necessary to identify multiple biosignatures and establish habitability for Earth-mass exoplanets in the habitable zones of nearby stars.},

In this review we focus on how disk-planet interactions drive the migration of planets when different assumptions are made about the physics of angular momentum transport and how it drives accretion flows in protoplanetary disk models. In particular, we consider migration in disks where (i) accretion flows arise because turbulence diffusively transports angular momentum; (ii) laminar accretion flows are confined to thin, ionized layers near disk surfaces and are driven by the launching of magneto-centrifugal winds, with the midplane being completely inert; (iii) laminar accretion flows pervade the full column density of the disk and are driven by a combination of large-scale horizontal and vertical magnetic fields.},

They can be considered as descendants of protoplanetary disks or components of planetary systems, providing valuable information on circumstellar disk evolution and the outcome of planet formation. The debris disk population can be explained by the steady collisional erosion of planetesimal belts; population models constrain where (10–100 au) and in what quantity ({\textgreater}1M⊕) planetesimals ({\textgreater}10 km in size) typically form in protoplanetary disks. Gas is now seen long into the debris disk phase. Some of these are secondary implying planetesimals have a solar system comet-like composition, but some systems may retain primordial gas. Ongoing planet formation processes are invoked for some debris disks, such as the continued growth of dwarf planets in an unstirred disk or the growth of terrestrial planets through giant impacts. Planets imprint structure on debris disks in many ways; images of gaps, clumps, warps, eccentricities and other disk asymmetries are readily explained by planets at ≫5 au. Hot dust in the region planets are commonly found ({\textless}5 au) is seen for a growing number of stars. This dust usually originates in an outer belt (e.g., from exocomets), although an asteroid belt or recent collision is sometimes inferred.},

Next we discuss how tightly packed systems inform us about planet formation conditions, if and how planets migrate, and survival in chaotic configurations. Along the way, we highlight several examples of packed exoplanet systems – the Kepler-11, Kepler-36, and HR 8799 – and compare them to Solar System benchmarks.

This chapter summarizes current super-Earth formation theories. It starts from the formation of rocky cores and subsequent accretion of gaseous envelopes. We follow the thermal evolution of newly formed super-Earths and discuss their atmospheric mass loss due to disk dispersal, photoevaporation, core-cooling, and collisions.

How do the elemental and chemical compositions of planets connect with their formation? The answer to this requires that the various pieces of planet formation theory be linked together in an end-to-end picture that is capable of addressing these large data sets. In this review, we discuss the critical elements of such a picture and how they affect the chemical and elemental makeup of forming planets. Important issues here include the initial state of forming and evolving disks, chemical and dust processes within them, the migration of planets and the importance of planet traps, the nature of angular momentum transport processes involving turbulence and/or MHD disk winds, planet formation theory, and advanced treatments of disk astrochemistry. All of these issues affect, and are affected by, the chemistry of disks which is driven by X-ray ionization of the host stars. We discuss how these processes lead to a coherent end-to-end model and how this may address the basic question.},

	abstract = {Our present-day atmosphere is often used as analog for potentially habitable exoplanets, but Earth’s atmosphere has changed dramatically throughout its 4.5-billion-year history. For example, molecular oxygen is abundant in the atmosphere today but was absent on the early Earth. Meanwhile, the physical and chemical evolution of Earth’s atmosphere has also resulted in major swings in surface temperature, at times resulting in extreme glaciation or warm greenhouse climates. Despite this dynamic and occasionally dramatic history, the Earth has been persistently habitable – and, in fact, inhabited – for roughly four billion years. Understanding Earth’s momentous changes and its enduring habitability is essential as a guide to the diversity of habitable planetary environments that may exist beyond our solar system and for ultimately recognizing spectroscopic fingerprints of life elsewhere in the universe.Here, we review long-term trends in the composition of Earth’s atmosphere as it relates to both planetary habitability and inhabitation. We focus on gases that may serve as habitability markers (CO2, N2) or biosignatures (CH4, O2), especially as related to the redox evolution of the atmosphere and the coupled evolution of Earth’s climate system. We emphasize that in the search for Earth-like planets, we must be mindful that the example provided by the modern atmosphere merely represents a single snapshot of Earth’s long-term evolution. In exploring the many former states of our own planet, we emphasize Earth’s atmospheric evolution during the Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic eons, but we conclude with a brief discussion of potential atmospheric trajectories into the distant future, many millions to billions of years from now. All of these “alternative Earth” scenarios provide insight to the potential diversity of Earth-like, habitable, and inhabited worlds.},

For planets, it is in contrast still a young method which only became important in recent years because of the rapid increase of the number of known extrasolar planets and the associated growth of statistical observational constraints. With planetary population synthesis, the theory of planet formation and evolution can be put to the test against these constraints. In this review of planetary population synthesis, we first briefly list key observational constraints. Then, the workflow in the method and its two main components are presented, namely, global end-to-end models that predict planetary system properties directly from protoplanetary disk properties and probability distributions for these initial conditions. An overview of various population synthesis models in the literature is given. The sub-models for the physical processes considered in global models are described: the evolution of the protoplanetary disk, planets’ accretion of solids and gas, orbital migration, and N-body interactions among concurrently growing protoplanets. Next, typical population synthesis results are illustrated in the form of new syntheses obtained with the latest generation of the Bern model. Planetary formation tracks, the distribution of planets in the mass-distance and radius-distance plane, the planetary mass function, and the distributions of planetary radii, semimajor axes, and luminosities are shown, linked to underlying physical processes, and compared with their observational counterparts. We finish by highlighting the most important predictions made by population synthesis models and discuss the lessons learned from these predictions – both those later observationally confirmed and those rejected.},

	abstract = {This chapter highlights the properties of turbulence and mesoscale flow structures in protoplanetary disks and their role in the planet formation process. Here we focus on the formation of planetesimals from a gravitational collapse of a pebble cloud. Large-scale and long-lived flow structures – vortices and zonal flows – are a consequence of weak magneto- and hydrodynamic instabilities in the pressure and entropy stratified quasi-Keplerian shear flow interacting with the fast rotation of the disk. The vortices and zonal flows on the other hand are particle traps tapping into the radial pebble flux of the disk, leading to locally sufficient accumulations to trigger gravitational collapse, directly converting pebbles to many kilometer sized planetesimals. This collapse is moderated by the streaming instability, which is a back-reaction from the particle accumulations onto the gas flow. Without trapping pebbles and increasing thus the local solid-to-gas ratio, this back-reaction would ultimately prevent the formation of planetesimals via turbulent diffusion. The formation of long-lived flow structures is therefore a necessary condition for an efficient and fast formation of planetesimals.},

This chapter describes the observed relations between exoplanet populations and stellar properties and how they connect to planet formation in protoplanetary disks. Giant planets occur more frequently around more metal-rich and more massive stars. These findings support the core accretion theory of planet formation, in which the cores of giant planets form more rapidly in more metal-rich and more massive protoplanetary disks. Smaller planets, those with sizes roughly between Earth and Neptune, exhibit different scaling relations with stellar properties. These planets are found around stars with a wide range of metallicities and occur more frequently around lower-mass stars. This indicates that planet formation takes place in a wide range of environments, yet it is not clear why planets form more efficiently around low-mass stars. Going forward, exoplanet surveys targeting M dwarfs will characterize the exoplanet population around the lowest-mass stars. In combination with ongoing stellar characterization, this will help us understand the formation of planets in a large range of environments.},

With direct access to the light from the planets themselves, extensive photometric and spectroscopic studies of the system have been undertaken, painting a fascinating picture of cloud formation, nonequilibrium chemistry, and potential elemental abundance measurements that can constrain formation pathways. The dynamical structure of the system is complex, with the four massive planets likely stabilized through participation in mean-motion resonances. Two belts of debris flank the planets, with a warm belt analogous to the solar system asteroid belt and a wide, cold ring comparable to the Kuiper belt.

The planet is surrounded by a translucent exosphere which overfills the Roche lobe and produces line-blanketing absorption in the near UV. The planet is losing mass. Another unusual property of the WASP-12 system is that observed chromospheric emission from the star is anomalously low: WASP-12 is an extreme outlier among thousands of stars when the log R’HK chromospheric activity indicator is considered. Occam’s razor suggests these two extremely rare properties coincide in this system because they are causally related. The absence of the expected chromospheric emission is attributable to absorption by a diffuse circumstellar gas shroud which surrounds the entire planetary system and fills our line of sight to the chromospherically active regions of the star. This circumstellar gas shroud is probably fed by mass loss from WASP-12b. The orbital eccentricity of WASP-12b is small but may be nonzero. The planet is part of a hierarchical quadruple system; its current orbit is consistent with prior secular dynamical evolution leading to a highly eccentric orbit followed by tidal circularization. When compared with the Galaxy’s population of planets, WASP-12b lies on the upper boundary of the sub-Jovian desert in both the (MP, P) and (RP, P) planes. Determining the mass-loss rate for WASP-12b will illuminate the mechanism(s) responsible for the sub-Jovian desert.},

Although a planet’s habitability depends critically on the effect of stellar type and planetary semimajor axis on climate balance, many additional factors can also impact habitability. Processes which can modify a habitable planet’s environment include photochemistry; stellar effects on climate balance; atmospheric loss; gravitational interactions with the star, moons, other planets and minor bodies; and galactic phenomena. Here we briefly review characteristics and processes that can impact exoplanet habitability. Ultimately, understanding these processes will enable identification of those exoplanets that are most likely to be habitable and will illuminate global characteristics of habitable planets that may be observable.},

Improvements in understanding the upper atmospheres of exoplanets and the time evolution of stellar X-ray to ultraviolet fluxes for a range of stellar masses have, together, enabled careful models of planet evolution that include the impact of atmospheric escape. A clear picture is emerging where some planets are left relatively unscathed, while others may experience substantial planetary evaporation that completely determines their bulk properties and ultimate fate.

The subtler statistical properties of this population are beginning to emerge with ever-increasing sample sizes: there is tentative evidence that planets on wide orbits are more frequent around stars that possess debris disks; brown dwarf companions exist at comparable (or perhaps slightly higher) rates as their counterparts in the planetary-mass regime; and the substellar companion mass function appears to be smooth and may extend down to the opacity limit for fragmentation.

	abstract = {Accretion of planetary material onto host stars may occur throughout a star’s life. Especially prone to accretion, extrasolar planets in short-period orbits, while relatively rare, constitute a significant fraction of the known population, and these planets are subject to dynamical and atmospheric influences that can drive significant mass loss. Theoretical models frame expectations regarding the rates and extent of this planetary accretion. For instance, tidal interactions between planets and stars may drive complete orbital decay during the main sequence. Many planets that survive their stars’ main sequence lifetime will still be engulfed when the host stars become red giant stars. There is some observational evidence supporting these predictions, such as a dearth of close-in planets around fast stellar rotators, which is consistent with tidal spin-up and planet accretion. There remains no clear chemical evidence for pollution of the atmospheres of main sequence or red giant stars by planetary materials, but a wealth of evidence points to active accretion by white dwarfs. In this article, we review the current understanding of accretion of planetary material, from the pre- to the post-main sequence and beyond. The review begins with the astrophysical framework for that process and then considers accretion during various phases of a host star’s life, during which the details of accretion vary, and the observational evidence for accretion during these phases.},

Here we briefly review Fomalhaut’s substantial role in the history of debris disk science that ultimately yielded the discovery of a low-mass common proper motion companion called Fomalhaut b (or Dagon). Fomalhaut b is comparable to other extrasolar planets known to have highly eccentric orbits, but it is currently unique among directly imaged planets in that it has only been detected in the optical and only with the Hubble Space Telescope. Its existence has been replicated by three independent studies of the same Hubble data, and its puzzling observational properties remain to be fully explained. The most plausible scenario is that 10–100 Myr-old exoplanets directly imaged many AU from their host star have very large Hill radii, which means that sub-Jupiter mass planets can be discovered via light scattering off sufficiently large and dusty rings and/or shrouds replenished by the collisional erosion of satellites.},

However, confounding forces are at play, such as the daunting computational task of parameter estimation and the presence of starspots whose effect on eclipse timing can degrade or, worse, bias the accuracy of our mass determinations. The circumbinary planets are subjected to far stronger gravitational perturbations than their single-star cousins. This creates a dynamic environment that challenges our planet formation and migration theories. Yet it is precisely this difficulty that makes understanding the circumbinary planets rewarding and valuable.},

	abstract = {Volcanic and tectonic activity affects the climate evolution of terrestrial planets and, by association, the potential that a planet could maintain liquid water at its surface over geological time scales. This connects the volcanic-tectonic state of a planet to the potential that it could allow for life as we know it. The Earth’s current volcanic-tectonic mode is plate tectonics. That mode may not have prevailed over the Earth’s geologic history, and it is not presently observed on other terrestrial planets in our solar system. As we have found more and more planets orbiting stars beyond our own, questions regarding the range of volcanic-tectonic modes that terrestrial planets can operate in and how these modes connect to planetary habitability have generated increased interest. A key issue for assessing life potential in our galaxy is the degree to which variable volcanic-tectonic modes can or cannot regulate surface temperatures to allow for persistent liquid water over geological time scales. This chapter reviews the range of volcanic-tectonic modes that have been proposed for terrestrial planets to date. The degree to which each particular mode can or cannot regulate planetary surface temperature remains uncertain but general considerations have been put forward and they are discussed herein. In particular, the hypothesis that volcanic-tectonic modes other than plate tectonics can allow a planet to maintain surface water, over time scales that allow for biological evolution, remains viable.},

	abstract = {The spectrum of an exoplanet reveals the physical, chemical, and biological processes that have shaped its history and govern its future. However, observations of exoplanet spectra are complicated by the overwhelming glare of their host stars. This chapter focuses on high-resolution spectroscopy (HRS) (R = 25, 000–100, 000), which helps to disentangle and isolate the exoplanet’s spectrum. At high spectral resolution, molecular features are resolved into a dense forest of individual lines in a pattern that is unique for a given molecule. For close-in planets, the spectral lines undergo large Doppler shifts during the planet’s orbit, while the host star and Earth’s spectral features remain essentially stationary, enabling a velocity separation of the planet. For slower-moving, wide-orbit planets, HRS, aided by high contrast imaging, instead isolates their spectra using their spatial separation. The lines in the exoplanet spectrum are detected by comparing them with high resolution spectra from atmospheric modelling codes; essentially a form of fingerprinting for exoplanet atmospheres. This measures the planet’s orbital velocity and helps define its true mass and orbital inclination. Consequently, HRS can detect both transiting and non-transiting planets. It also simultaneously characterizes the planet’s atmosphere, due to its sensitivity to the depth, shape, and position of the planet’s spectral lines. These are altered by the planet’s atmospheric composition, structure, clouds, and dynamics, including day-to-night winds and its rotation period. This chapter describes the HRS technique in detail, highlighting its successes in exoplanet detection and characterization, and concludes with the future prospects of using HRS to identify biomarkers on nearby rocky worlds and map features in the atmospheres of giant exoplanets.},

Unlike spectrophotometric instruments observing planetary transits, an interferometer does not rely on any particular geometric constraints and could characterize exoplanets with any orbital configuration around nearby stars. The idea to use an infrared nulling interferometer to characterize exoplanets dates back to Bracewell (Nature 274:780, 1978) and was extensively studied in the 1990s and 2000s by both ESA and NASA. The project focuses on the mid-infrared regime (5–20 μm), which provides access to key features of exoplanets, such as their size, their temperature, the presence of an atmosphere, their climate structure, as well as the presence of important atmospheric molecules such as H2O, CO2, O3, NH3, and CH4. This wavelength regime also provides a favorable planet/star contrast to detect the thermal emission of temperate (∼300 K) exoplanets (107 vs 1010 in the visible). In this chapter, we first review the scientific rationale of a mid-infrared nulling interferometer and present how it would provide an essential context for interpreting detections of possible biosignatures. Then, we present the main technological challenges identified during the ESA and NASA studies, and how they have progressed over the last 10 years. Finally, we discuss which technologies remain to be developed before flying such an instrument and possible ways to make Darwin/TPF a reality in the midterm future.},

The most significant discovery, overall, is that rocky extrasolar planets have bulk elemental compositions similar to those of Earth and other rocky objects in our solar system. The white dwarf studies reveal that many extrasolar minor planets (asteroids) are differentiated, possessing analogs of terrestrial crust, mantle, and core; this finding has important implications for the origin of our own solar system.},

	abstract = {Exoplanets orbiting close to their parent stars have been observed to lose a fraction of their atmosphere into space: they “evaporate.” The escape of atmospheric gas is due to the large X-ray to ultraviolet (XUV) energy input from the nearby host-star into the upper atmosphere of the planet. Evaporation is characterized through the transit observations of escaping atoms and ions, like hydrogen atoms at Lyman-α, ionized or neutral carbon, oxygen, and magnesium in the UV. Detailed modeling of this phenomenon has to take into account a large number of important physical processes, like the interactions of the upper atmosphere with the stellar environment, radiation pressure, photoionization, self-shielding, charge exchanges, and magnetic interactions with the stellar wind. Massive evaporation can lead some gaseous exoplanets to lose a large fraction of their atmosphere and undergo a significant change in their nature. As a result, some short period, small exoplanets are potentially the remnant of former more massive planets. Evaporation is thus an important process that sculpts the structure of planetary systems with a significant and measurable effect on exoplanets at short orbital distances.},

These discoveries reveal us a large diversity of planets, from super-Earths to hot Jupiters, orbiting host stars of different masses, ages, and metallicities. Moreover, the detected exoplanetary systems present a broad variety of orbital architectures that shows that the solar system is not typical. In addition, some of the detected telluric planets orbit within the habitable zone of their host stars. This challenges our understanding of the formation, the evolution, and the stability of planetary systems. In this context, tidal interactions should be coherently modeled taking advantage of the different observational signatures they have in our Earth-Moon system, in the solar system, and in exoplanetary systems. They reveal how tidal dissipation in celestial bodies varies strongly as a function of their internal structure and dynamics. In this chapter, we make a complete review of the physical mechanisms driving tidal friction in stars, giant planets, and telluric planets. For each type of celestial bodies, we discussed in details the state of the art of their modeling and how the resulting predictions compare to observations. We show the importance to adopt a stellar and planetary physicist perspective when studying tidal dissipation in planetary systems.},

In the future, exo-cartography could yield surface maps of terrestrial planets, hinting at the geophysical and geochemical processes that shape them.},

Impacts on the stellar surface or dynamo as well as on the planetary atmosphere and internal structure are expected from these interactions. The magnetic field also plays a huge role in the formation and evolution of the system. The magnetic properties of planet-host stars, however, are barely known. Although it is impossible to spatially resolve the stellar surface of any star other than the Sun, spectropolarimetry allows probing the global large-scale magnetic strength and orientation at a given time. Then, monitoring polarized signatures over time as the star rotates gives us the possibility to reconstruct the topology of the magnetic field at the stellar surface. The method, the planet-host star sample observed so far, and the conclusions obtained from such observations are presented. Fifteen stars with planets have a detected and characterized magnetic field, including the Sun. Although global properties of stars with planets apparently resemble those of stars without known planets, detailed characterization of specific systems has opened a way to probe the energetic environment of exoplanets, with applications on radio emission, habitability, stellar wind/planetary atmosphere interactions, orbital decay, and Ohmic dissipation.},

Perhaps the primary contribution from asteroseismology to the research on transiting exoplanets is the determination of very precise stellar radii that translate into precise planetary radii, but asteroseismology has also proven useful in constraining eccentricities of exoplanets as well as the dynamical architecture of planetary systems.

The challenge of the coming decade is to move from demography to physical characterization. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is poised to open a revolutionary new phase in our understanding of exoplanets with transit spectroscopy of relatively short period planets and coronagraphic imaging of ones with wide separations from their host stars. This article discusses the wide variety of exoplanet opportunities enabled by JWST’s sensitivity and stability, its high angular resolution, and its suite of powerful instruments. These capabilities will advance our understanding of planet formation, brown dwarfs, and the atmospheres of young to mature planets.},

As a consequence, a large range of planetary bulk densities have been charted, giving important clues to the compositions, the interior structures, and the geophysical processes that typify extrasolar planets. Moreover, two decades of investigations – both observational and theoretical – have generated a compound of important insights and enduring mysteries. Taken broadly, the observations and models indicate that most giant planets have an inhomogeneous structure consisting of a heavy element core and a hydrogen-helium envelope which is itself divided into a liquid metallic inner component and a molecular outer component. This basic architecture is consistent with the core-accretion theory of giant planet formation. Simultaneously, however, many short-period giant planets exhibit anomalously large radii, which are commonly interpreted as indicating the existence of a structurally important source (or sources) of interior heating. We review the range of physical mechanisms that can potentially generate these inflated radii, and we discuss the directions by which progress can potentially be made with future research.},

The most direct path towards its achievement is the detection and atmospheric characterization of terrestrial exoplanets with potentially habitable surface conditions. The nearest ultracool dwarfs (UCDs), i.e., very-low-mass stars and brown dwarfs with effective temperatures lower than 2700 K, represent a unique opportunity to reach this goal within the next decade. The potential of the transit method for detecting potentially habitable Earth-sized planets around these objects is drastically increased compared to Earth-Sun analogs. A terrestrial planet transiting a nearby UCD could be an exquisite target for a thorough atmospheric characterization, including the search for possible biosignatures, with near-future facilities such as the James Webb Space Telescope. In this chapter, we first describe the physical properties of UCDs as well as the unique potential they offer for the detection of potentially habitable Earth-sized planets suitable for atmospheric characterization. Then, we present the SPECULOOS ground-based transit survey, that will search for Earth-sized planets transiting the nearest UCDs, as well as its prototype survey on the TRAPPIST telescopes. We conclude by discussing the prospects offered by the recent detection by this prototype survey of a system of seven temperate Earth-sized planets transiting a nearby UCD, TRAPPIST-1.},

Here we focus on high-energy radiation since it penetrates deeply the atmosphere ionizing and heating the gas, thus affecting its chemistry with consequences very different from those of optical or UV radiation. Stellar activity is inhomogeneous and variable; flares in particular can be very frequent and intense in young and dM stars. Depending on their duty cycle, they may drive the atmospheric gas toward different chemical regimes.},

The light curve, i.e., the increase in source brightness as function of time, mainly contain information about the lens star and its exoplanets, but higher order details also depend on the source star and its possible exoplanets, so the most detailed analyses require simultaneous model fit to all the components. The models can reveal the mass and dynamics of the system but can also reveal details of, for example, the atmospheric structure of the source star. Microlensing is an optimal method to obtain unbiased information about the stellar lens population, detailed information about the source star atmosphere, and statistics on exoplanets with mass and orbits similar to the planets in the solar system, including planets beyond the snow line and even unbound planets. Microlensing events can be found in a wide distance range throughout our own Galaxy, as well as in principle in other galaxies too.},

In related research topics, Spitzer observed the debris left over from the formation of planetary systems and studied Y dwarfs, the cold, free-floating analogs of Jovian mass objects.

Here, we present a series of concepts designed for handling this task. STARE is a small satellite concept dedicated to finding planets in the very nearest stellar systems, which offers a low-cost option toward the study of habitable planets. The NEAT concept is a set of two formation-flying satellites with the aim to survey the 200 nearest Sunlike stars for Earths in the habitable zone. Finally, THEIA is a proposal for an ESA M-class mission, with a single-unit telescope designed for both dark matter studies and a survey for habitable Earthlike planets among the 50 nearest stars. The concepts illustrate various possible paths and strategies for achieving exquisite astrometric performance and thereby addressing key scientific questions regarding the distribution of habitability and life in the universe.},

Kepler is the tenth in the series of NASA Discovery Program missions that were competitively selected, PI-directed, medium-cost missions.The Kepler instrument is based on a 0.95 m aperture Schmidt-design telescope with a 113 sq deg FOV with 84 channels of CCD detectors. The spacecraft orbits the Sun in 53-week orbit and points at a single field of stars to avoid missing transits. It achieves a photometric precision of 10 ppm for bright, quiet stars for planets with transit times of several hours.During the 4 years of its operation, an analysis of its data detected over 4,600 planetary candidates which include several hundred Earth-size planetary candidates, over 3,458 confirmed planets, and 21 Earth-size and super-Earth-size planets in the HZ. These discoveries provide the information required for estimates of the frequency of planets in our galaxy. The mission results show that most stars have planets, many of these planets are similar in size to the Earth, and systems with several planets are common. In combination with radial velocity measurements, the Kepler results were able to distinguish rocky planets from planets that might be composed mostly of water or gas. The Kepler Mission also made major contributions to astrophysical sciences including the detection of “heartbeat” stars, supernovae, and the interior structure and characteristics of red giant stars. At the end of its 4-year mission, the Kepler Mission was re-proposed as a community facility (“K2”) that provided high-precision photometric time-series data for tens of thousands of stars in each of 13 FOVs along the ecliptic.},

It will provide the unique capability of determining accurate radii for a subset of those planets for which the mass has already been estimated from ground-based spectroscopic surveys. It will also provide precise radii for new planets discovered by the next generation of ground- or space-based transit surveys (Neptune-size and smaller). By unveiling transiting exoplanets with high potential for in-depth characterization, CHEOPS will also provide prime targets for future instruments suited to the spectroscopic characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres.To reach these goals, CHEOPS will measure photometric signals with a precision of 20 ppm over 6 h for a magnitude 9 star in the V band. This precision will be achieved by using a single-frame transfer, back-side illuminated CCD detector located in the focal plane assembly of a 33-cm diameter on-axis telescope. The optical design is based on a Ritchey-Chrétien telescope that produces a defocused image of the target star while minimizing the stray light contamination with a dedicated field stop and a baffling system.

This method has the highest detection sensitivity to exoplanets located in the cold regions of their planetary systems – behind the “snow line” (1–10 AU), where the gas and ice giants presumably form, according to theoretical predictions. It is sensitive to a wide range of planetary masses – from the Mars-mass objects up to super-Jupiters, brown dwarfs, and stars. Because microlensing effects are independent of the luminosity but depend only on the lens mass, it is the only method that is not biased by the planetary system hosts, allowing discoveries of exoplanets orbiting regular stars, dark low-mass stars, or brown dwarfs. It is also capable to discover exoplanets around white dwarfs or neutron stars.We present here a summary of the contribution of microlensing searches to the exoplanet field from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) project perspective. The OGLE survey is one of the largest long-term photometric sky surveys worldwide, and in 2017 it celebrates its 25 years of continuous operation. OGLE actively participated in almost all exoplanet discoveries with the microlensing method and pioneered the transit technique of exoplanet detection.},

	abstract = {The KELT project was originally designed as a small-aperture, wide-field photometric survey that would be optimally sensitive to planets transiting bright (V∼8 to 10) stars. This magnitude range corresponded to the gap between the faint magnitude limit where radial velocity surveys were complete, and the bright magnitude limit for transiting planet hosts routinely found by dedicated ground-based transit surveys. Malmquist bias and other factors have also led the KELT survey to focus on discovering planets transiting relatively hot host stars. To date, the survey has discovered 22 transiting hot Jupiters, including some of the brightest transiting planet host stars known to date. Over half of these planets transit rapidly rotating stars with Teff {\textgreater} 6250 K, which had been largely eschewed by both radial velocity and transit surveys, due to the challenge of obtaining precision radial velocities for such stars. The KELT survey has developed a protocol and specialized software for confirming transiting planets around stars rotating as rapidly as 200 km/s. This chapter reviews the KELT planet discoveries, describes their scientific value, and also briefly discusses the non-exoplanet science produced by the KELT project, especially long-timescale phenomena and preparations for the TESS mission.},

	abstract = {Planets interact with their host stars through gravity, radiation, and magnetic fields, and for those giant planets that orbit their stars within ∼10 stellar radii (∼0.1 AU for a sun-like star), star-planet interactions (SPI) are observable with a wide variety of photometric, spectroscopic, and spectropolarimetric studies. At such close distances, the planet orbits within the sub-Alfvénic radius of the star in which the transfer of energy and angular momentum between the two bodies is particularly efficient. The magnetic interactions appear as enhanced stellar activity modulated by the planet as it orbits the star rather than only by stellar rotation. These SPI effects are informative for the study of the internal dynamics and atmospheric evolution of exoplanets. The nature of magnetic SPI is modeled to be strongly affected by both the stellar and planetary magnetic fields, possibly influencing the magnetic activity of both, as well as affecting the irradiation and even the migration of the planet and rotational evolution of the star. As phase-resolved observational techniques are applied to a large statistical sample of hot Jupiter systems, extensions to other tightly orbiting stellar systems, such as smaller planets close to M dwarfs become possible. In these systems, star-planet separations of tens of stellar radii begin to coincide with the radiative habitable zone where planetary magnetic fields are likely a necessary condition for surface habitability.},

The dark, localized spots give rise to a rotationally modulated background signal that both increases the fractional depth of exoplanet transits and increases the variability of the background against which they are detected. The convective motions of the electrically conducting photospheric gas are inhibited in spots and in facular regions, again producing rotationally modulated variability in spectral line shapes as the star rotates. Here I discuss the physical phenomena that give rise to these forms of variability, their impact on the detection and characterization of extrasolar planets, and proxy indicators and observing strategies that can mitigate this impact.},

The CCDs have a pixel scale of 0.4 arcsecond and cover a 2 by 2 square degree field of view (FOV) on the sky. The observing systems have been installed at three sites in southern hemisphere: Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, South African Astronomical Observatory in South Africa, and Siding Spring Observatory in Australia. All three systems are commissioned in 2015 and currently running regular scientific operation. Based on a carefully designed observing strategy utilizing the unique feature of wide FOV and round-the-clock observing capability, it is anticipated that KMTNet will detect exoplanets with as low mass as that of the Earth and obtain statistically unbiased census from the survey.

Subsequent spacecraft investigations have revealed that many of the planets, and even some moons, either have or have had a planetary-scale magnetic field. In the case of the Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, the magnetic field is generated by dynamo processes within the planet, and an interaction between the solar wind and their magnetic fields generates intense radio emission via the electron cyclotron maser instability. Not only may the radio emissions be a means for discovering extrasolar planets, because magnetic fields are tied to the properties of planetary interiors, radio emissions may be a remote sensing means of constraining extrasolar planetary properties that will be otherwise difficult to access. In the case of terrestrial planets, the presence or absence of a magnetic field may be an indicator for habitability. While no extrasolar planets have yet been detected in the radio, new ground-based telescopes and new possibilities for space-based telescopes provide promise for the near future.},

	abstract = {In this chapter, we will deal with the discovery of the first extrasolar planets around normal stars. This discovery took place in the mid-1990s thanks to the analysis of periodic Doppler shifts in stellar spectra and turned out to be a landmark achievement, in that it established a new field of research that is growing at full speed since then, and at the same time, it answered a question – do other worlds exist in the cosmos? – that dates back to ancient times. This major result was made possible by the impressive improvement in Doppler analysis techniques during the second half of the twentieth century, until the precision boosted to values suitable to detect massive planets in close-in orbits. In the late 1980s, two objects came to the limelight: HD 114762 b and γ Cep b. They were suspected to be exoplanets, but it was not possible to rule out alternative explanations, so no undisputable discovery could be claimed. A few years later, in 1995, the discovery of 51 Peg b was announced and confirmed as the first secure one. However, the features of this planet were quite weird as compared to those of the planets of the Solar System, as it was massive and very close to its parent star. Its discovery overturned the previously widespread idea that other systems had to be made like ours and opened the floodgates to the spotting of many other planets. In this chapter, we will tell this story, mainly dwelling upon the historical and epistemological aspects.},

Various infrared technologies are used including a laser frequency comb, a new wide-pitch echelle grating, stable ceramic optical bench, and reflective optics. Its main goal is to detect habitable Earth-like planets around late M stars.

	abstract = {Early thinking about detecting extrasolar planets was largely circumscribed by the expectation that other solar systems would be similar to our own, the only known example at the time. Given this mind-set, transit detections were expected to be exceedingly difficult for small planets and rarely seen for larger ones. The discovery of 51 Peg and subsequent hot Jupiters by the radial velocity method completely upended our thinking – transits were suddenly practical, perhaps even easy! This immediately led to follow-up searches for transits in systems discovered by the radial velocity technique and, conversely, to wide-field ground-based transit search programs with radial velocity follow-up observations. As is usually the case, transit work turned out to be harder than initially expected but was still possible and productive. This chapter reviews the circumstances leading to the first transit observations of HD 209458, the early OGLE exoplanets, and TrES-1 and TrES-2, as well as some of the frustrations and difficulties encountered along the way.},

An external companion gravitationally tugs the host star, causing periodic changes in pulsation arrival times. This method is most sensitive to detecting substellar companions around the hottest pulsating stars, especially compact remnants like white dwarfs and hot subdwarfs, as well as δ Scuti variables (A stars). However, it is applicable to any pulsating star with sufficiently stable oscillations. Care must be taken to ensure that the changes in pulsation arrival times are not caused by intrinsic stellar variability; an external, light-travel-time effect from an exoplanet identically affects all pulsation modes. With more long-baseline photometric campaigns coming online, this method is yielding new detections of substellar companions.},

A common sharing of atmospheres is that they are dominantly supported by seasonally varying sublimation/condensation exchanges with the surface. Io’s atmosphere is still fundamentally different from Pluto and Triton in that it presents large horizontal variability. Pluto’s atmosphere, and to a lesser extent Triton’s, are reduced (∼10 μbar class) and colder versions of Titan’s, including in particular a coupled nitrogen-methane chemistry that leads to the production of hydrocarbons, nitriles, and haze. Albeit similar in terms of surface pressure and temperature, Pluto’s and Triton’s atmospheres show marked differences in terms of thermal structure and detailed composition – that are amenable to differences in the ∼20 times smaller atmospheric methane mixing ratio on Triton versus Pluto – itself related to a smaller abundance in the ice phase. Io’s dominantly SO2, nanobar-class atmosphere has immediate support mostly from sublimating surface frost, with a contribution from volcanic plumes. The latter are also important in feeding the atmosphere with nonvolatile gases including SO, S2, NaCl, and KCl. The gas temperature, vertical structure, and dynamics of Io’s atmosphere remain poorly understood.},

	abstract = {A transiting rocky planet 8 parsecs away
Most exoplanets have been detected using either the radial velocity (RV) method or the transit method, which provide only limited information on the planet's physical properties. In the rare cases in which both methods detect the same planet, the combination determines the planet's mass, radius, and density. Trifonov et al. identified a planet, Gliese 486 b, using both RV and transit data. The host star is a red dwarf only 8 parsecs away, making this one of the closest exoplanet systems known. A rocky super-Earth, Gliese 486 b has an equilibrium surface temperature of 700 kelvin. The authors say that it is observationally favorable for searches for an atmosphere.
Science, this issue p. 1038
Spectroscopy of transiting exoplanets can be used to investigate their atmospheric properties and habitability. Combining radial velocity (RV) and transit data provides additional information on exoplanet physical properties. We detect a transiting rocky planet with an orbital period of 1.467 days around the nearby red dwarf star Gliese 486. The planet Gliese 486 b is 2.81 Earth masses and 1.31 Earth radii, with uncertainties of 5\%, as determined from RV data and photometric light curves. The host star is at a distance of {\textasciitilde}8.1 parsecs, has a J-band magnitude of {\textasciitilde}7.2, and is observable from both hemispheres of Earth. On the basis of these properties and the planet’s short orbital period and high equilibrium temperature, we show that this terrestrial planet is suitable for emission and transit spectroscopy.

1151, a quiescent M4.5 dwarf star, has radio emission properties
consistent with theoretical expectations of star-planet interactions for
an Earth-sized planet on a 1-5 day orbit. New near-infrared radial
velocities from the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) spectrometer on
the 10m Hobby-Eberly Telescope at McDonald Observatory, combined with
previous velocities from HARPS-N, reveal a periodic Doppler signature
consistent with an \$m{\textbackslash}sin i = 2.5 {\textbackslash}pm 0.5 M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ exoplanet on a
2.02-day orbit. Precise photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite (TESS) shows no flares or activity signature, consistent with
a quiescent M dwarf. While no planetary transit is detected in the TESS
data, a weak photometric modulation is detectable in the photometry at a
\${\textbackslash}sim2\$ day period. This independent detection of a candidate planet
signal with the Doppler radial-velocity technique adds further weight to
the claim of the first detection of star-exoplanet interactions at radio

	abstract = {One of the critical challenges facing imaging studies of the 21-cm signal at the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is the separation of astrophysical foreground contamination. These foregrounds are known to lie in a wedge-shaped region of (������⊥, ������ ) Fourier space. Removing these Fourier modes excises the foregrounds at grave expense to image ﬁdelity, since the cosmological information at these modes is also removed by the wedge ﬁlter. However, the 21-cm EoR signal is non-Gaussian, meaning that the lost wedge modes are correlated to the surviving modes by some covariance matrix. We have developed a machine learning-based which exploits this information to identify ionized regions within a wedge-ﬁltered image. Our method reliably identiﬁes the largest ionized regions and can reconstruct their shape, size, and location within an image. We further demonstrate that our method remains viable when instrumental eﬀects are accounted for, using the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array and the Square Kilometre Array as ﬁducial instruments. The ability to recover spatial information from wedge-ﬁltered images unlocks the potential for imaging studies using current- and nextgeneration instruments without relying on detailed models of the astrophysical foregrounds themselves.},

	abstract = {Segmented mirror telescope designs address issues of mechanical rigidity, but introduce the problem of aligning, or cophasing, the separate segments to conform to the optimum mirror shape. While several solutions have been widely adopted, a few difficulties persist — the introduction of non-common path errors and an artificial division of the problem into coarse and fine regimes involving separate dedicated hardware solutions. Here we propose a novel method that addresses many of these issues. Fizeau Interferometric Cophasing of Segmented Mirrors (FICSM) uses non-redundant sparse aperture interferometry to phase mirror segments to interferometric precision using unexceptional science hardware. To show the potential of this technique we numerically simulate conditions on NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), showing that the FICSM method has the potential to phase the primary mirror from an initial state with segment-to-segment pistons as large as 150 microns and tilts as large as 0.5 arcseconds, to produce a final state with 0.75 nm rms segment-to-segment pistons and 3.7 mas rms segment tilts. The image undergoes monotonic improvement during this process. This results in a rms wavefront error of 3.65 nm, well below the 100 nm requirement of JWST’s coarse phasing algorithm.},

We use the state-of-the-art nested sampling algorithm P C to compare a wide variety of stellar activity models, including simple models exploiting linear correlations between RVs and stellar activity indicators, harmonic models for the activity signals, and a more sophisticated Gaussian process regression model. We show that the use of overly-simplistic stellar activity models that are not well-motivated physically can lead to spurious ‘detections’ of planetary signals that are almost certainly not real. We also reveal some diﬃculties inherent in parameter and model inference in cases where multiple planetary signals may be present. Our study thus underlines the importance both of exploring a variety of competing models and of understanding the limitations and precision settings of one’s sampling algorithm. We also show that at least in the case of HD 13808, we always arrive at consistent conclusions about two particular signals present in the RV, regardless of the stellar activity model we adopt; these two signals correspond to the previously-reported though unconﬁrmed planet candidate signals. Given the robustness and precision with which we can characterize these two signals, we deem them secure planet detections. In particular, we ﬁnd two planets orbiting HD 13808 at distances of 0.11, 0.26 AU with periods of 14.2, 53.8 d, and minimum masses of 11, 10 ������⊕.},

Radial velocity data sets are then analysed to determine the presence of activity induced signals. We measure a radial velocity signal induced by rotational modulation of stellar surface features in 37 stars, from late F-type to mid M-type stars. We report an empirical relationship, with some degree of spectral type dependency, between the mean level of chromospheric emission measured by the log10(RHK) and the measured radial velocity semi amplitude. We also report a relationship betweeen the semi amplitude of the chromospheric measured signal and the semi amplitude of the radial velocity induced signal, which strongly depends on the spectral type. We ﬁnd that for a given strength of chromospheric activity (i.e. a given rotation period) M-type stars tend to induce larger rotation related radial velocity signals than G and K-type stars.},

	abstract = {Excalibur is a non-parametric, hierarchical framework for precision 
wavelength-calibration of spectrographs. It is designed with the needs
of extreme-precision radial velocity (EPRV) in mind, which require that
instruments be calibrated or stabilized to better than \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$ pixels.
Instruments vary along only a few dominant degrees of freedom,
especially EPRV instruments that feature highly stabilized optical
systems and detectors. Excalibur takes advantage of this property by
using all calibration data to construct a low-dimensional representation
of all accessible calibration states for an instrument. Excalibur also
takes advantage of laser frequency combs or etalons, which generate a
dense set of stable calibration points. This density permits the use of
a non-parametric wavelength solution that can adapt to any instrument or
detector oddities better than parametric models, such as a polynomial.
We demonstrate the success of this method with data from the EXtreme
PREcision Spectrograph (EXPRES), which uses a laser frequency comb. When
wavelengths are assigned to laser comb lines using excalibur, the RMS of
the residuals is about five times lower than wavelengths assigned using
polynomial fits to individual exposures. Radial-velocity measurements of
HD 34411 showed a reduction in RMS scatter over a 10-month time baseline

	abstract = {The observed radii distribution of Kepler exoplanets reveals two distinct populations: those that are more likely to be terrestrials (≲1.7R ⊕) and those that are more likely to be gas-enveloped (≳2R ⊕). There exists a clear gap in the distribution of radii that separates these two kinds of planets. Mass-loss processes like photoevaporation by high-energy photons from the host star have been proposed as natural mechanisms to carve out this radius valley. These models favor underlying core mass function of sub-Neptunes that is sharply peaked at ∼4–8M ⊕, but the radial-velocity follow-up of these small planets hints at a more bottom-heavy mass function. By taking into account the initial gas accretion in gas-poor (but not gas-empty) nebula, we demonstrate that (1) the observed radius valley is a robust feature that is initially carved out at formation during late-time gas accretion; and (2) that it can be reconciled with core mass functions that are broad extending well into the sub-Earth regime. The maximally cooled isothermal limit prohibits cores lighter than ∼1–2M ⊕ from accreting enough mass to appear gas-enveloped. The rocky-to-enveloped transition established at formation produces a gap in the radius distribution that shifts to smaller radii farther from the star, similar to that observed. For the best agreement with the data, our late-time gas accretion model favors dust-free accretion in hotter disks with cores slightly less dense than the Earth (∼0.8ρ ⊕) drawn from a mass function that is as broad as .},

	abstract = {In an earlier campaign to characterize the mass of the transiting temperate super-Earth K2-18b with HARPS, a second, non-transiting planet was posited to exist in the system at 9 days. Further radial velocity follow-up with the CARMENES spectrograph visible channel revealed a much weaker signal at 9 days, which also appeared to vary chromatically and temporally, leading to the conclusion that the origin of the 9-day signal was more likely related to stellar activity than to a planetary presence. Here we conduct a detailed reanalysis of all available RV time-series - including a set of 31 previously unpublished HARPS measurements - to investigate the effects of time-sampling and of simultaneous modelling of planetary plus activity signals on the existence and origin of the curious 9-day signal. We conclude that the 9-day signal is real and was initially seen to be suppressed in the CARMENES data due to a small number of anomalous measurements, although the exact cause of these anomalies remains unknown. Investigation of the signal's evolution in time with wavelength and detailed model comparison reveals that the 9-day signal is most likely planetary in nature. Using this analysis, we reconcile the conflicting HARPS and CARMENES results and measure precise and self-consistent planet masses of mp,b = 8.63 ± 1.35 and mp,c sinic = 5.62
± 0.84 Earth masses. This work, along with the previously
published RV papers on the K2-18 planetary system, highlights the importance of understanding the time-sampling and of modelling the simultaneous planet plus stochastic activity, particularly when
searching for sub-Neptune-sized planets with radial velocities.

	abstract = {Exoplanets orbiting M-dwarfs present a valuable opportunity for their detection and atmospheric characterization. This is evident from recent inferences of H2O in such atmospheres, including that of the habitable-zone exoplanet K2-18b. With a bulk density between Earth and Neptune, K2-18b may be expected to possess a H/He envelope. However, the extent of such an envelope and the thermodynamic conditions of the interior remain unexplored. In the present work, we investigate the atmospheric and interior properties of K2-18b based on its bulk properties and its atmospheric transmission spectrum. We constrain the atmosphere to be H2-rich with a H2O volume mixing ratio of 0.02\%–14.8\%, consistent with previous studies, and find a depletion of CH4 and NH3, indicating chemical disequilibrium. We do not conclusively detect clouds/hazes in the observable atmosphere. We use the bulk parameters and retrieved atmospheric properties to constrain the internal structure and thermodynamic conditions in the planet. The constraints on the interior allow multiple scenarios between rocky worlds with massive H/He envelopes and water worlds with thin envelopes. We constrain the mass fraction of the H/He envelope to be ≲6\%; spanning ≲10−5 for a predominantly water world to ∼6\% for a pure iron interior. The thermodynamic conditions at the surface of the H2O layer range from the supercritical to liquid phases, with a range of solutions allowing for habitable conditions on K2-18b. Our results demonstrate that the potential for habitable conditions is not necessarily restricted to Earth-like rocky exoplanets.},

	abstract = {The recent detections of two transit events attributed to the super-Earth candidate K2-18b have provided the unprecedented prospect of spectroscopically studying a habitable-zone planet outside the solar system. Orbiting a nearby M2.5 dwarf and receiving virtually the same stellar insolation as Earth, K2-18b would be a prime candidate for the ﬁrst detailed atmospheric characterization of a habitable-zone exoplanet using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)and James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST). Here, we report the detection of a third transit of K2-18b near the predicted transit time using the Spitzer Space Telescope. The Spitzer detection demonstrates the periodic nature of the two transit events discovered by K2, conﬁrming that K2-18 is indeed orbited by a super-Earth in a 33 day orbit, ruling out the alternative scenario of two similarly sized, long-period planets transiting only once within the 75 day Kepler Space Telescope (K2) observation. We also ﬁnd, however, that the transit event detected by Spitzer occurred 1.85 hr (7s) before the predicted transit time. Our joint analysis of the Spitzer and K2 photometry reveals that this early occurrence of the transit is not caused by transit timing variations, but the result of an inaccurate ephemeris due to a previously undetected data anomaly in the K2 photometry. We reﬁt the ephemeris and ﬁnd that K2-18b would have been lost for future atmospheric characterizations with HST and JWST if we had not secured its ephemeris shortly after the discovery. We caution that immediate follow-up observations as presented here will also be critical for conﬁrming and securing future planets discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), in particular if only two transit events are covered by the relatively short 27-day TESS campaigns.},

	abstract = {We conducted speckle imaging observations of 53 stellar systems that were members of long-term radial velocity (RV) monitoring campaigns and exhibited substantial accelerations indicative of planetary or stellar companions in wide orbits. Our observations were made with blue and red filters using the Differential Speckle Survey Instrument at Gemini-South and the NN-Explore Exoplanet Stellar Speckle Imager at the WIYN
telescope. The speckle imaging identifies eight luminous companions within two arcseconds of the primary stars. In three of these systems (HD 1388, HD 87359, and HD 104304), the properties of the imaged companion are consistent with the RV measurements, suggesting that these companions may be associated with the primary and the cause of the RV variation. For all 53 stellar systems, we derive differential magnitude limits (i.e., contrast curves) from the imaging. We extend this analysis to include upper limits on companion mass in systems without imaging detections. In 25 systems, we rule out companions with mass greater than 0.2{\textasciitilde}\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, suggesting that the observed RV signals are caused by late M dwarfs or substellar (potentially planetary) objects. On the other hand, the joint RV and imaging analysis almost entirely rules out planetary explanations of the RV signal for HD 19522 and suggests that the companion must have an angular separation below a few tenths of an arcsecond. This work highlights the importance of combined RV and imaging observations for characterizing the outer regions of nearby planetary systems.},

sums of 'eigengalaxies' and how eigengalaxies can be used in a
probabilistic framework to enable principled and simplified approaches
in a variety of applications. Eigengalaxies can be derived from a
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of sets of single- or multiband
images. They encode the image space equivalent of basis vectors that can
be combined to describe the structural properties of large samples of
galaxies in a massively reduced manner. As an illustration, we show how
a sample of  10243 galaxies in the Hubble Space Telescope CANDELS survey
can be represented by just 12 eigengalaxies. We show in some detail how
this image space may be derived and tested. We also describe a
probabilistic extension to PCA (PPCA) which enables the eigengalaxy
framework to assign probabilities to galaxies. We present four practical
applications of the probabilistic eigengalaxy framework that are
particularly relevant for the next generation of large imaging surveys:
we (i) show how low likelihood galaxies make for natural candidates for
outlier detection; (ii) demonstrate how missing data can be predicted;
(iii) show how a similarity search can be performed on exemplars; (iv)
demonstrate how unsupervised clustering of objects can be implemented.},

	abstract = {The spectral resolving power R = λ/δλ is a key 
property of any spectrograph, but its definition is vague because the `smallest resolvable wavelength difference' δλ does not
have a consistent definition. Often, the FWHM is used, but this is not consistent when comparing the resolution of instruments with different forms of spectral line-spread function. Here, two methods for
calculating resolving power on a consistent scale are given. The first method is based on the principle that two spectral lines are just resolved when the mutual disturbance in fitting the fluxes of the lines reaches a threshold (here equal to that of sinc2 profiles at the Rayleigh criterion). The second criterion assumes that two
spectrographs have equal resolving powers if the wavelength error in fitting a narrow spectral line is the same in each case (given equal signal flux and noise power). The two criteria give similar results and give rise to scaling factors that can be applied to bring resolving power calculated using the FWHM on to a consistent scale. The
differences among commonly encountered line-spread functions are substantial, with a Lorentzian profile (as produced by an imaging Fabry-Perot interferometer) being a factor of two worse than the boxy profile from a projected circle (as produced by integration across the spatial dimension of a multi-mode fibre) when both have the same FWHM. The projected circle has a larger FWHM than its true resolution, so using FWHM to characterise the resolution of a spectrograph which is fed by multi-mode fibres significantly underestimates its true resolving power if it has small aberrations and a well-sampled profile.},

The key objective of The Assembly of Galaxies theme is to determine how galaxies and the dark matter, gas, stars, metals, morphological structures, and active nuclei within them evolved from the epoch of reionization to the present day. The key objective of The Birth of Stars and Protoplanetary Systems theme is to unravel the birth and early evolution of stars, from infall on to dust-enshrouded protostars to the genesis of planetary systems. The key objective of the Planetary Systems and the Origins of Life theme is to determine the physical and chemical properties of planetary systems including our own, and investigate the potential for the origins of life in those systems. Within these themes and objectives, we have derived representative astronomical observations. To enable these observations, JWST consists of a telescope, an instrument package, a spacecraft, and a sunshield. The telescope consists of 18 beryllium segments, some of which are deployed. The segments will be brought into optical alignment on-orbit through a process of periodic wavefront sensing and control. The instrument package contains the four science instruments and a fine guidance sensor. The spacecraft provides pointing, orbit maintenance, and communications. The sunshield provides passive thermal control. The JWST operations plan is based on that used for previous space
observatories, and the majority of JWST observing time will be allocated to the international astronomical community through annual peer-reviewed proposal opportunities.},

	title = {Détection de naines brunes et planètes géantes gazeuses à grande séparation utilisant des images d’archive},
	abstract = {Decades of astronomical data collection provided by dedicated instruments have led to a large amount of images taken at di erent wavelengths, resolutions and depths of ﬁeld that remain, for the most part, unexploited (eg 2MASS , WISE, SPITZER, SDSS). Developments of new data processing algorithms gives a new value to these images taken years earlier. This project aims at discovering new low-mass companions with large separations around young low-mass stars (M-type) using archive images. 2MASS J, H and Ks band images were used to identify the candidates. Seven candidates were identiﬁed using a combination of two algorithms that were applied on a judicious selection of 2 812 stars. The method combined a point spread function substraction algorithm based on a linear combination of reference stars and an algorithm inspired by di erential imaging. Five of them had already been identiﬁed by other teams. One was probably an M9 star from the ﬁeld and the other an L3—, potentially a member of the young association AB Doradus. This research conﬁrms, like others before, the low occurence rate of planetary mass and brown dwarf companions at large separations (Á 100 AU) around young low mass stars. This conclusion led us to develop of an alternative detection method sensitive to companions on short orbits ({\textless} 40 AU). This second project, partially completed, aims to demonstrate that it is possible to detect objects with planetary masses orbiting young sun-like stars (G–F–A) regardless of their separation. This is possible thanks to the new generation of high dispersion infrared spectrographs. Spectral processing applied on synthetic observations has conﬁrmed that one can detect objects with an object/star brightness ratio down to 10´5. Only 1h exposure time with an instrument like SPIROU is enough to detect companions with an atmosphere mainly composed of molecules. The spectral processing consists of cross-correlation and spectral subtraction algorithms inspired by methods used in di erential imaging.},

The system also contains a bound white dwarf companion TOI-1259B with a projected distance of approximately 1600 AU from the planet host. Transits are observed in nine TESS sector and are 2.7 per cent deep - among the deepest known - making TOI-1259Ab a promising target for atmospheric characterization. Our follow-up radial velocity measurements indicate a variability of semiamplitude K = 71 m/s, implying a planet mass of 0.44 Mjup. By fitting the spectral energy distribution of the white dwarf we derive a total age of 4.08 (+1.21 -0.53) Gyr for the system. The K-dwarf's light curve reveals a rotational variability with a period of 28 days, which implies a gyrochronology age broadly consistent with the white dwarf's total age.},

The observations do not prove the non-existence of small circumbinary planets, but rather they are much harder to find than around single stars, because their transit timing variations are much larger than the transit durations. We present STANLEY: an automated algorithm to find small circumbinary planets. It employs custom methods to detrend eclipsing binary light curves and stack shallow transits of variable duration and interval using N-body integrations. Applied to the Kepler circumbinaries, we recover all known planets, including the three planets of Kepler-47, and constrain the absence of additional planets of similar or smaller size. We also show that we could have detected {\textless} 3 Earth radii planets in half of the known systems. Our work will ultimately be applied to a broad sample of eclipsing binaries to (hopefully) produce new discoveries, and derive a circumbinary size distribution which can be compared to that for single stars.},

	abstract = {Stellar light curves are well known to encode physical stellar properties. Precise, automated and computationally inexpensive methods to derive physical parameters from light curves are needed to cope with the large influx of these data from space-based missions such as Kepler and TESS. Here we present a new methodology which we call The Swan, a fast, generalizable and effective approach for deriving stellar surface gravity (\${\textbackslash}log g\$) for main sequence, subgiant and red giant stars from Kepler light curves using local linear regression on the full frequency content of Kepler long cadence power spectra. With this inexpensive data-driven approach, we recover \${\textbackslash}log g\$ to a precision of \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.02 dex for 13,822 stars with seismic \${\textbackslash}log g\$ values between 0.2-4.4 dex, and \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.11 dex for 4,646 stars with Gaia derived \${\textbackslash}log g\$ values between 2.3-4.6 dex. We further develop a signal-to-noise metric and find that granulation is difficult to detect in many cool main sequence stars (\$T\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{eff\}\}\$ \${\textbackslash}lesssim\$ 5500 K), in particular K dwarfs. By combining our \${\textbackslash}log g\$ measurements with Gaia radii, we derive empirical masses for 4,646 subgiant and main sequence stars with a median precision of \${\textbackslash}sim\$7\%. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can be used to recover \${\textbackslash}log g\$ to a similar mean absolute deviation precision for TESS-baseline of 27 days. Our methodology can be readily applied to photometric time-series observations to infer stellar surface gravities to high precision across evolutionary states.},

Through a joint modelling of follow-up radial velocity observations with CARMENES, IRD, and HARPS together with extensive ground-based photometric follow-up observations with LCOGT, MuSCAT, and MuSCAT2, we determined a precise planetary mass, Mb = 1.86 ± 0.30 M⊕, and radius, Rb = 1.264 ± 0.050 R⊕. Additionally, we report the discovery of a second, temperate, non-transiting planet in the system, GJ 3473 c, which has a minimum mass, Mc sin i = 7.41 ± 0.91 M⊕, and orbital period, Pc = 15.509 ± 0.033 d. The inner planet of the system, GJ 3473 b, is one of the hottest transiting Earth-sized planets known thus far, accompanied by a dynamical mass measurement, which makes it a particularly attractive target for thermal emission spectroscopy.},

	abstract = {We present the discovery of TOI 540 b, a hot planet slightly smaller than Earth orbiting the low-mass star 2MASS J05051443-4756154. The planet has an orbital period of P = 1.239149 days (± 170 ms) and a radius of r = 0.903±0.052 R⊕, and is likely terrestrial based on the observed mass-radius distribution of small exoplanets at similar insolations. The star is 14.008 pc away and we estimate its mass and radius to be M = 0.159 ± 0.014 M and R = 0.1895 ± 0.0079 R , respectively. The star is distinctive in its very short rotational period of Prot = 17.4264 + / − 0.0094 hours and correspondingly small Rossby number of 0.007 as well as its high X-ray-to-bolometric luminosity ratio of LX /Lbol = 0.0028 based on a serendipitous XMM-Newton detection during a slew operation. This is consistent with the X-ray emission being observed at a maximum value of LX /Lbol 10−3 as predicted for the most rapidly rotating M dwarfs. TOI 540 b may be an alluring target to study atmospheric erosion due to the strong stellar X-ray emission. It is also among the most accessible targets for transmission and emission spectroscopy and eclipse photometry with JWST, and may permit Doppler tomography with high-resolution spectroscopy during transit. This discovery is based on precise photometric data from TESS and ground-based follow-up observations by the MEarth team.},

	abstract = {We report the discovery of two transiting brown dwarfs (BDs), TOI-811b and TOI-852b, from NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite mission. These two transiting BDs have similar masses, but very diﬀerent radii and ages. Their host stars have similar masses, eﬀective temperatures, and metallicities. The younger and larger transiting BD is TOI-811b at a mass of Mb = 55.3 ± 3.2MJ and radius of Rb = 1.35 ± 0.09RJ and it orbits its host star in a period of P = 25.16551 ± 0.00004 days. Its age of 93+−6219 Myr, which we derive from an application of gyrochronology to its host star, is why this BD’s radius is relatively large, not heating from its host star since this BD orbits at a longer orbital period than most known transiting BDs. This constraint on the youth of TOI-811b allows us to test substellar mass-radius isochrones where the radius of BDs changes rapidly with age. TOI852b is a much older (4.0 Gyr from stellar isochrone models of the host star) and smaller transiting BD at a mass of Mb = 53.7 ± 1.3MJ, a radius of Rb = 0.75 ± 0.03RJ, and an orbital period of P = 4.94561 ± 0.00008 days. TOI-852b joins the likes of other old transiting BDs that trace out the oldest substellar mass-radius isochrones where contraction of the BD’s radius asymptotically slows. Both host stars have a mass of M = 1.32M ± 0.05 and diﬀer in their radii, Teﬀ , and [Fe/H] with TOI-811 having R = 1.27 ± 0.09R , Teﬀ = 6107 ± 77K, and [Fe/H] = +0.40 ± 0.09 and TOI-852 having R = 1.71 ± 0.04R , Teﬀ = 5768 ± 84K, and [Fe/H] = +0.33 ± 0.09. We take this opportunity to examine how TOI-811b and TOI-852b serve as test points for young and old substellar isochrones, respectively.},

	abstract = {Small planets on close-in orbits tend to exhibit envelope mass fractions of either effectively zero or up to a few percent depending on their size and orbital period. Models of thermally-driven atmospheric mass loss and of terrestrial planet formation in a gas-poor environment make distinct predictions regarding the location of this rocky/non-rocky transition in period-radius space. Here we present the confirmation of TOI-1235 b (\$P=3.44\$ days, \$r\_p=1.738{\textasciicircum}\{+0.087\}\_\{-0.076\}\$ R\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$), a planet whose size and period are intermediate between the competing model predictions thus making the system an important test case for emergence models of the rocky/non-rocky transition around early M dwarfs (\$R\_s=0.630{\textbackslash}pm 0.015\$ R\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, \$M\_s=0.640{\textbackslash}pm 0.016\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$). We confirm the TESS planet discovery using reconnaissance spectroscopy, ground-based photometry, high-resolution imaging, and a set of 38 precise radial-velocities from HARPS-N and HIRES. We measure a planet mass of \$6.91{\textasciicircum}\{+0.75\}\_\{-0.85\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$, which implies an iron core mass fraction of \$20{\textasciicircum}\{+15\}\_\{-12\}\$\% in the absence of a gaseous envelope. The bulk composition of TOI-1235 b is therefore consistent with being Earth-like and we constrain a H/He envelope mass fraction to be \${\textless}0.5\$\% at 90\% confidence. Our results are consistent with model predictions from thermally-driven atmospheric mass loss but not with gas-poor formation, suggesting that the former class of processes remain efficient at sculpting close-in planets around early M dwarfs. Our RV analysis also reveals a strong periodicity close to the first harmonic of the photometrically-determined stellar rotation period that we treat as stellar activity, despite other lines of evidence favoring a planetary origin (\$P=21.8{\textasciicircum}\{+0.9\}\_\{-0.8\}\$ days, \$m\_p{\textbackslash}sin\{i\}=13.0{\textasciicircum}\{+3.8\}\_\{-5.3\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$) that cannot be firmly ruled out by our data.},

By combining 63 precise radial-velocity measurements from HARPS and HARPS-N, we measure planet masses of \$m\_\{p,b\}=2.62{\textasciicircum}\{+0.48\}\_\{-0.46\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ and \$m\_\{p,c\}=8.6{\textasciicircum}\{+1.6\}\_\{-1.3\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$, which indicates that LTT 3780b has a bulk composition consistent with being Earth-like, while LTT 3780c likely hosts an extended H/He envelope. We show that the recovered planetary masses are consistent with predictions from both photoevaporation and from core-powered mass loss models.

We explore a variety of atmospheric compositions, pressures, and rotation states for both ocean-covered and completely desiccated planets in order to assess the planet's potential for habitability. For all 20 of our simulated cases, we use our climate model outputs to synthesize transmission spectra, combined-light spectra, and integrated broadband phase curves. These climatologically-informed observables will help the community assess the technological capabilities necessary for future characterization of this planet, as well as distinguish possible climate states if one day we do obtain sensitive spectral observations. We find that TOI-700 d is a robust candidate for a habitable world and can potentially maintain temperate surface conditions under a wide variety of atmospheric compositions. Unfortunately, the spectral feature depths from the resulting transmission spectra and the peak flux and variations from our synthesized phase curves do not exceed 10 ppm. This will likely prohibit the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) from characterizing its atmosphere; however, this motivates the community to invest in future instrumentation that perhaps can one day reveal the true nature of TOI-700 d.},

	abstract = {We present the discovery and validation of a three-planet system orbiting the nearby (31.1 pc) M2 dwarf star TOI-700 (TIC 150428135). TOI-700 lies in the TESS continuous viewing zone in the Southern Ecliptic Hemisphere; observations spanning 11 sectors reveal three planets with radii ranging from 1 R\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ to 2.6 R\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ and orbital periods ranging from 9.98 to 37.43 days. Ground-based follow-up combined with diagnostic vetting and validation tests enable us to rule out common astrophysical false-positive scenarios and validate the system of planets. The outermost planet, TOI-700 d, has a radius of \$1.19{\textbackslash}pm0.11\$ R\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ and resides in the conservative habitable zone of its host star, where it receives a flux from its star that is approximately 86\% of the Earth's insolation. In contrast to some other low-mass stars that host Earth-sized planets in their habitable zones, TOI-700 exhibits low levels of stellar activity, presenting a valuable opportunity to study potentially-rocky planets over a wide range of conditions affecting atmospheric escape. While atmospheric characterization of TOI-700 d with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be challenging, the larger sub-Neptune, TOI-700 c (R = 2.63 R\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$), will be an excellent target for JWST and beyond. TESS is scheduled to return to the Southern Hemisphere and observe TOI-700 for an additional 11 sectors in its extended mission, which should provide further constraints on the known planet parameters and searches for additional planets and transit timing variations in the system.},

TOI-700 d has a radius of \$1.220{\textasciicircum}\{+0.073\}\_\{-0.063\}R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ and orbits within its host star's conservative habitable zone with a period of 37.42 days (\$T\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{eq\} {\textbackslash}sim 269\$ K).

Our \$Spitzer\$ observations confirm the TESS detection of TOI-700 d and remove any remaining doubt that it is a genuine planet. We analyze the \$Spitzer\$ light curve combined with the 11 sectors of TESS observations and a transit of TOI-700 c from the LCOGT network to determine the full system parameters. With an expected RV semi-amplitude of \${\textbackslash}sim\$80 cm/s, it may be possible to measure the mass of TOI-700 d using state-of-the-art radial velocity instruments.},

	abstract = {Directly imaged planets and substellar companions are key targets for the characterization of self-luminous atmospheres. Their photometric appearance at 4-5 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m is sensitive to the chemical composition and cloud content of their atmosphere. We aim at systematically characterizing the atmospheres of directly imaged low-mass companions at 4-5 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m. We want to homogeneously process the data and compile a photometric library at thermal wavelengths of these mostly young, low-gravity objects. In this way, we want to find trends related to their spectral type and surface gravity by comparing with isolated brown dwarfs and predictions from atmospheric models. We have used the high-resolution, high-contrast capabilities of NACO at the VLT to directly image the companions of HIP 65426, PZ Tel, and HD 206893 in the NB4.05 and/or \$M'\$ filters. For the same targets, and additionally \${\textbackslash}beta\$ Pic, we have also analyzed six archival VLT/NACO datasets which were taken with the NB3.74, \$L'\$, NB4.05, and \$M'\$ filters. The \$L'\$-NB4.05 and \$L'\$-\$M'\$ colors of the studied sample are all red while the NB4.05-\$M'\$ color is blue for \${\textbackslash}beta\$ Pic b, gray for PZ Tel B, and red for HIP 65426 b and HD 206893 B (although typically with low significance). The absolute NB4.05 and \$M'\$ fluxes of our sample are all larger than those of field dwarfs with similar spectral types. Finally, the surface gravity of \${\textbackslash}beta\$ Pic b has been constrained to \${\textbackslash}log\{g\} = 4.17\_\{-0.13\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.10\}\$ dex from its photometry and dynamical mass. A red color at 3-4 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m and a blue color at 4-5 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m might be (partially) caused by H\$\_2\$O and CO absorption, respectively. The red characteristics of \${\textbackslash}beta\$ Pic b, HIP 65426 b, and HD 206893 B at 3-5\${\textbackslash}mu\$m, as well as their higher fluxes in NB4.05 and \$M'\$ compared to field dwarfs, indicate that cloud densities are enhanced close to the photosphere as a result of their low surface gravity.},

programme that aims to detect Earth-like planets orbiting low-mass
stars. Aims: We develop least-squares fitting algorithms to
derive the RVs and additional spectral diagnostics implemented in the
SpEctrum Radial Velocity AnaLyser (SERVAL), a publicly available python
code. Methods: We measured the RVs using high signal-to-noise
templates created by coadding all available spectra of each star. We
define the chromatic index as the RV gradient as a function of
wavelength with the RVs measured in the echelle orders. Additionally, we
computed the differential line width by correlating the fit residuals
with the second derivative of the template to track variations in the
stellar line width. Results: Using HARPS data, our SERVAL code
achieves a RV precision at the level of 1 m/s. Applying the chromatic
index to CARMENES data of the active star YZ CMi, we identify apparent
RV variations induced by stellar activity. The differential line width
is found to be an alternative indicator to the commonly used full width
half maximum. Conclusions: We find that at the red optical
wavelengths (700-900 nm) obtained by the visual channel of CARMENES, the
chromatic index is an excellent tool to investigate stellar active
regions and to identify and perhaps even correct for activity-induced RV
variations.},

orbiting nearby stars. Two main techniques are used to obtain precision
Doppler measurements at optical wavelengths. The first approach is the
gas cell method, which consists of least-squares matching of the
spectrum of iodine imprinted on the spectrum of the star. The second
method relies on the construction of a stabilized spectrograph
externally calibrated in wavelength. The most precise stabilized
spectrometer in operation is the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet
Searcher (HARPS), operated by the European Southern Observatory in La
Silla Observatory, Chile. The Doppler measurements obtained with HARPS
are typically obtained using the cross-correlation function (CCF)
technique. This technique consists of multiplying the stellar spectrum
by a weighted binary mask and finding the minimum of the product as a
function of the Doppler shift. It is known that CCF is suboptimal in
exploiting the Doppler information in the stellar spectrum. Here we
describe an algorithm to obtain precision radial velocity measurements
using least-squares matching of each observed spectrum to a high
signal-to-noise ratio template derived from the same observations. This
algorithm is implemented in our software HARPS-TERRA (Template-Enhanced
Radial velocity Re-analysis Application). New radial velocity
measurements on a representative sample of stars observed by HARPS are
used to illustrate the benefits of the proposed method. We show that,
compared with CCF, template matching provides a significant improvement
in accuracy, especially when applied to M dwarfs.},

Life on Earth, through its gaseous products and reflectance and scattering properties, has left its fingerprint on the spectrum of our planet. Aided by the universality of the laws of physics and chemistry, we turn to Earth's biosphere, both in the present and through geologic time, for analog signatures that will aid in the search for life elsewhere. Considering the insights gained from modern and ancient Earth, and the broader array of hypothetical exoplanet possibilities, we have compiled a comprehensive overview of our current understanding of potential exoplanet biosignatures, including gaseous, surface, and temporal biosignatures. We additionally survey biogenic spectral features that are well known in the specialist literature but have not yet been robustly vetted in the context of exoplanet biosignatures. We briefly review advances in assessing biosignature plausibility, including novel methods for determining chemical disequilibrium from remotely obtainable data and assessment tools for determining the minimum biomass required to maintain short-lived biogenic gases as atmospheric signatures. We focus particularly on advances made since the seminal review by Des Marais et al. The purpose of this work is not to propose new biosignature strategies, a goal left to companion articles in this series, but to review the current literature, draw meaningful connections between seemingly disparate areas, and clear the way for a path forward.

Planetary systems around low-mass stars and brown dwarfs are very different from our solar system: the planets are expected to be much closer than Mercury, in a layout that could resemble the system of Jupiter and its moons. The recent discoveries point in that direction with, for example, the system of Kepler-42 and especially the system of TRAPPIST-1 which has seven planets in a configuration very close to the moons of Jupiter. Low-mass stars and brown dwarfs are thought to be very common in our neighborhood and are thought to host many planetary systems. The planets orbiting in the habitable zone of brown dwarfs (and very low-mass stars) represent one of the next challenges of the following decades: they are the only planets of the habitable zone whose atmosphere we will be able to probe (e.g., with the JWST).},

This necessarily means that habitats on other worlds vary substantially from those with which we are familiar. Organic evolution under the different selective pressures in those alien environments may be expected to give rise to forms of life that are exotic by comparison with our own. Many forms of life may lie beyond the reach of light from their central star due to distance or subsurface sequestration, requiring other sources of energy. Life that could float among the clouds in dense atmospheres might assume sizes and morphologies of remarkable dimensions. Some life could be reminiscent of microbial forms on Earth but remain quiescent in soil or rock until seasonal transitions or the periodic passage of a terminator between frigid darkness and scorching daylight temporarily brings them to life. Cells bounded by amphiphilic membranes stable in hydrocarbon solvents may thrive in the petrochemical seas of worlds too cold for the existence of liquid water. Finally, structural entities capable of self-assembly and energy consumption may populate alien habitats, despite lacking anything like the cellular organization of life on Earth. Exotic forms of life clearly may be found well beyond the limits of any zone deemed habitable merely by the potential for water in liquid form.},

The so-called false positives may occur when another process or suite of processes masks or mimics a biosignature. Here, we examine several leading biosignatures, then introduce potential false positives for these signals, and finally discuss methods to discriminate between the two using current and future detection technologies.

These elements did not condense within the Earth’s accretion zone; they were volatilized to space during planetary collisions, and/or they sunk into the Earth’s iron core. The Earth’s inventories arrived within minor outer solar system objects. We can extrapolate that life does well with meagre supplies of biological elements and that the distal regions of stellar systems do provide these elements. Life strongly modulates the subsequent rock, ocean, and atmosphere cycles of these elements. These contingencies limit what details can be exported to earthlike exoplanets. With regard to C-rich exoplanets, a graphite rind develops during accretion. A rind of frozen metallic silicon develops on Si-rich planets. Even in these cases, the outer stellar system supplies the locally rare elements CHONPS. Life evolves to prosper in the conditions it actually faces. For example, the rinds are strongly reducing. Life will probably evolve ways to gather, create, store, and utilize oxidants that are far from equilibrium with the general environment.},

Observational techniques like high-contrast imaging and transit spectroscopy can reveal key indicators of habitability for exoplanets. Both polarization measurements and specular reflectance from oceans (also known as “glint”) can provide direct evidence for surface liquid water, while constraining surface pressure and temperature (from moderate resolution spectra) can indicate liquid water stability. Indirect evidence for habitability can come from a variety of sources, including observations of variability due to weather, surface mapping studies, and/or measurements of water vapor or cloud profiles that indicate condensation near a surface. Approaches to making the types of measurements that indicate habitability are diverse and have different considerations for the required wavelength range, spectral resolution, maximum noise levels, stellar host temperature, and observing geometry.},

Simulations show that the proposed Exo-Earth Imager flotilla (EEI), with its 100 mirrors of 3 m forming a 100 km meta-aperture, can produce a direct image of an exo-Earth at 3 parsecs, containing 30× 30 resolved elements. This requires accurate control of the meta-mirror’s shape, preferably parabolic for directly co-phasing the beams co-focused toward a focal spaceship. According to the principle of hypertelescope imaging, a pupil densifier element is also needed in the focal optics for concentrating the planet’s light, otherwise spread within a broad diffractive halo. And exoplanet imaging also requires coronagraphic optics for attenuating the contaminating light from the parent star.},

With few exceptions, by far the most important source of energy determining the planet’s surface conditions is instellation from the host star. This is not a constant quantity over the star’s life. If long-term stability is necessary to support detectable life, then the stellar evolution must be taken into account when determining habitability. Stellar composition in turn has a fundamental effect on stellar evolution. The range of variation in individual elements observed in nearby stars is much larger than what is considered in most stellar modeling and can result in gigayear-scale changes in the evolution of sun-like stars. Measurements of stellar composition can also provide insight into the nature of the planets themselves.},

	abstract = {The local galactic environment has been suspected to influence planetary habitability in numerous ways. Very metal-poor regions of the Galaxy, or those largely devoid of atoms more massive than H and He, are thought to be unable to form habitable planets. Moreover, if such planets do form, the newly formed system is subjected to close stellar passages while it still resides in its stellar birth cluster. After star clusters disperse, various potential hazards still remain. For instance, the central galactic regions may present risks to planetary habitability via nearby supernovae, gamma ray bursts (GRBs), and frequent comet showers. In addition, planets residing within very wide binary star systems are affected by the Galaxy, as local gravitational perturbations from the Galaxy can increase the binary’s eccentricity until it destabilizes the planets it hosts. Here we review the most recent work on the main galactic influences over planetary habitability. Although there must be some metallicity limit below which rocky planets cannot form, recent exoplanet surveys show that they form around stars with a very large range of metallicities. Once formed, the probability of star cluster environments destabilizing planetary systems only becomes high for rare, extremely long-lived clusters. Regarding the threats to habitability from supernovae, GRBs, and comet showers, many recent studies of these processes suggest that their hazards are more limited than originally thought. Finally, denser regions of the Galaxy will enhance the threat that very wide binary companions pose to planetary habitability, but the probability that a very wide binary star will disrupt habitability will always be substantially below 100\% for any galactic environment. While some regions of the Milky Way must be more hospitable to habitable planets than others, it is very difficult to state that habitable planets are confined to any well-defined region of the Galaxy or that any other particular region of the Galaxy is completely devoid of habitable planets.},

It is important to characterize the interiors of exoplanets to understand planetary diversity and further determine how unique, or not, Earth is. Assessing interior structure is challenging because there are few data and large uncertainties. Thus, for a given exoplanet, a range of interior structure models can satisfy available data. Typically, interior models aim to constrain the radial structure and composition of the core and mantle and additionally ice, ocean, and gas layer if appropriate. Constraining the parameters of these layers may also inform us about interior dynamics. However, it remains challenging to constrain interior dynamics using interior structure models because structure models are relatively insensitive to the thermal state of a planet. Nevertheless, elucidating interior dynamics remains a key goal in exoplanetology due to its role in determining surface conditions and hence habitability. Thus far, Earth-like habitability can be excluded for super-Earths that are in close proximity to their stars and therefore have high surface temperatures that promote local magma oceans.},

Extensions of the VRE, spectral “edges” produced in part by photosynthetic or nonphotosynthetic pigments, may likewise present potential evidence of life. Polarization signatures have the capacity to discriminate between biotic and abiotic “edge” features in the face of false positives from bandgap-generating material. Temporal biosignatures – modulations in measurable quantities such as gas abundances (e.g., CO2), surface features, or emission of light (e.g., fluorescence, bioluminescence) that can be directly linked to the actions of a biosphere – are in general less well studied than surface or gaseous biosignatures. However, remote observations of Earth’s biosphere nonetheless provide proofs of concept for these techniques and are reviewed here. Surface and temporal biosignatures provide complementary information to gaseous biosignatures and, while likely more challenging to observe, would contribute information inaccessible from study of the time-averaged atmospheric composition alone.},

The first dedicated scientific instruments like SPHERE on VLT and GPI on Gemini South have only been commissioned in 2013–2014. HCI is thus a rather young field of research, still very prolific with a lot of technical solutions proposed to improve the actual instrument concepts. A lot of new technical solutions have been recently proposed to improve actual instrument concepts. Since most of them have not yet been tested at the expected level of performance and/or in real conditions, it is rather difficult to define precisely which solutions will be the most efficient scientifically with respect to the future technical, environmental, and operational constraints. Among these different solutions, I will describe and discuss the main directions of development required to optimize the future HCI instruments on speckle suppression, wavefront correction, and detection methods.},

	abstract = {Habitable planet properties can be significantly influenced by gravitational interactions with the host star(s), companion planets, and natural satellites. Gravitational perturbations from neighboring planets can modify a planet’s orbital and rotational properties, which are primary drivers of climate and habitability. Planets on tight orbits can experience a tidal deformation due to a large gravitational gradient across their diameters, which cause orbits to shrink and circularize, rotational frequencies to evolve toward the orbital frequency, obliquities to decay to 0 or π, and internal friction that heats the interior. Large natural satellites can overwhelm the rotational perturbations of stars and planets, but they are unstable for habitable planets orbiting stars less than half as massive as our Sun. These gravitational interactions can produce arbitrarily complex evolutionary trajectories, but theoretical models can be applied to almost any system to provide a reasonable representation of a habitable planet’s orbital and rotational history.},

	abstract = {Recent results in exoclimatology suggest that double-star systems are capable of hosting habitable worlds. The presence of a second source of radiation as well as additional gravitational interactions can influence the location and extent of circumstellar and circumbinary habitable zones, however. In this chapter, several concepts such as isophote-based, radiative, and dynamically informed habitable zones are revisited. They help reveal where terrestrial planets can retain liquid water in such environments. Combining orbital dynamics with simple climate models we demonstrate that the size of circumstellar habitable zones depends on a planet’s climate inertia. The higher a climate’s resilience to variations in the incident light, the higher the chances for planets to remain in a habitable state. In systems like α Centauri, a low climate inertia shrinks the habitable zone by 50\%. For circumbinary planets the mass-ratio of the stars and their distance to the habitable zone determine the impact of climate inertia on planetary habitability. Systems with similar stellar components akin to Kepler-35 turn out to be excellent places to search for potentially habitable worlds.},

We may be guided by the examples of remote sensing of planets Mars, Venus, and Earth. Spectroscopy allows to identify a gas and to measure its column abundance. If this gas is well mixed in the atmosphere (i.e., CO2, O2, methane for Titan), the column abundance is higher above regions of lower latitude, allowing a determination of altitude. Acquiring some spatial resolution on the disc of the exoplanet requires telescopes of sizes of hundreds of kilometers, feasible with the concept of a diluted pupil. There are still some possibilities when the exoplanet is seen as a single-point, which will be the case for the next tens of years. Both the cases of transiting and nontransiting planets are examined, with reflected star light or thermal emission. For transiting planets, the study of secondary eclipses (when the planet disappears progressively behind the star) is promising. However, it is pointed out that nontransiting exoplanets in the habitable zone of their host star are statistically three to nine times nearer the Earth than transiting planets, enabling three to nine times smaller telescopes to achieve the same signal to noise ratio.},

Additionally, bacteria emit greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide into the atmosphere, and vegetation can emit a variety of organic molecules. In an exoplanetary context, it is important to consider whether such gas-phase species – so-called atmospheric biosignatures – could be detected spectroscopically and attributed to extraterrestrial life. Another signature of life on Earth is the so-called redox disequilibrium of its atmosphere. This refers to the presence of simultaneously oxidizing and reducing species (e.g., molecular oxygen and methane). Without life, such species would react and be removed on relatively fast timescales. Since Earth’s atmosphere has changed considerably during its history, we will also consider atmospheric biosignatures in the context of the early Earth. This chapter will present a brief literature review of atmospheric biosignatures. We will discuss the main photochemical responses of such species in the modern and early Earth’s atmosphere and their potential to act as atmospheric biosignatures in an exoplanetary context.},

Currently, we have discovered hundreds of Earth-sized planets, several of them within the habitable zone of their star. In the coming years, the efforts will concentrate in the characterization of these planets and their atmospheres to try to detect the presence of biosignatures. However, even if we discovered a second Earth, it is very unlikely that it would present a stage of evolution similar to the present-day Earth. Our planet has been far from static since its formation about 4.5 Ga ago; on the contrary, during this time, it has undergone multiple changes in its atmospheric composition, its temperature structure, its continental distribution, and even changes in the forms of life that inhabit it. All these changes have affected the global properties of Earth as seen from an astronomical distance. Thus, it is of interest not only to characterize the observables of the Earth as it is today but also at different epochs. Here we review the detectability of the Earth’s globally averaged properties over time. This includes atmospheric composition and biosignatures and surface properties that can be interpreted as signs of habitability (bioclues). The resulting picture is that truly unambiguous biosignatures are only detectable for about 1/4 of the Earth’s history. For the rest of the time, we rely on detectable bioclues that can only establish an statistical likelihood for the presence of life on a given planet.},

But, as theorists have known for decades now, there are some formidable obstacles to meeting that requirement. Many of these problems, and potentially their solutions, are associated with the growth and migration of “pebbles” (∼mm/cm-sized solids) in the first few million years of a disk’s lifetime. That is especially fortuitous, since the thermal continuum emission from these particles in nearby disks can be readily detected and resolved with long-baseline radio interferometers. This chapter describes what is being learned about the early evolution of solids by comparing such data with sophisticated simulations. Specifically, the focus will be on the observable signatures of particle growth and migration and the mounting evidence that small-scale substructures in the (gas) disk play fundamental – and perhaps mandatory – roles in the planet formation process.},

Significant eclipse time perturbations have been measured in over 30 systems. Planetary orbits have been proposed for ten of these, six of them requiring two or more planets to fit the observed variations. The present picture is however confused, with several proposed orbits failing in the light of new data or proving to be dynamically unstable. Internal structural changes of the component stars are a probable source of the noise in these measurements, although proposed mechanisms struggle to explain the magnitude of the timing variations seen in several systems. Future progress requires sources of guaranteed timing stability. Some have already been found, and many more can be expected from current and future variability surveys.},

We briefly discuss how the light is then affected by the spectrograph and recorded by a detector, resulting in an observed planet spectrum. As will be seen, one of the major challenges for measuring the effects of a planet’s atmosphere in an observed spectrum is disentangling them from effects caused by the instrumentation used to acquire that spectrum.

The properties of the stars that are part of the early statistical sample wererevisited, including for instance measurements from the Gaia Data Release 2.

At such orbital separations, these objects resemble higher-mass versions of the directly imaged planetary mass companions to the 10-30 Myr, intermediate-mass stars HR 8799, β Pictoris, and HD 95086. These newly discovered companions span the brown dwarf desert, and their masses and orbital radii provide a new constraint on models of the formation of low-mass stellar and substellar companions to intermediate-mass stars.

	abstract = {Context. The young systemsPZ Tel and HD 1160, hosting known low-mass companions, were observed during the commissioning of the new planet finder of the Very Large Telescope (VLT) SPHERE with several imaging and spectroscopic modes. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We aim to refine the physical properties and architecture of both systems. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We use SPHERE commissioning data and dedicated Rapid Eye Mount (REM) observations, as well as literature and unpublished data from VLT/SINFONI, VLT/NaCo, Gemini/NICI, and Keck/NIRC2. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We derive new photometry and confirm the short-term (P = 0.94 d) photometric variability of the star PZ Tel A with values of 0.14 and 0.06 mag at optical and near-infrared wavelengths, respectively. We note from the comparison to literature data spanning 38 yr that the star also exhibits a long-term variability trend with a brightening of {\textasciitilde}0.25 mag. The 0.63-3.8 μm spectral energy distribution of PZ Tel B (separation {\textasciitilde}25 AU) allows us to revise its physical characteristics: spectral type M7 ± 1, T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 2700 ± 100 K, log(g) \&lt; 4.5 dex, luminosity log(L/L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) = -2.51 ± 0.10 dex, and mass 38-72 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} from "hot-start" evolutionary models combining the ranges of the temperature and luminosity estimates. The 1-3.8 μm SED of HD 1160 B ({\textasciitilde}85 au) suggests a massive brown dwarf or a low-mass star with spectral type M6.0, T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 3000 ± 100 K, subsolar metallicity [M/H] = -0.5-0.0 dex, luminosity log(L/L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) = -2.81 ± 0.10 dex, and mass 39-166 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. The physical properties derived for HD 1160 C ({\textasciitilde}560 au) from K{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}s{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}L'-band photometry are consistent with the discovery study. The orbital study of PZ Tel B confirms its deceleration and the high eccentricity of its orbit (e \&gt; 0.66). For eccentricities below 0.9, the inclination, longitude of the ascending node, and time of periastron passage are well constrained. In particular, both star and companion inclinations are compatible with a system seen edge-on. Based on "hot-start" evolutionary models, we reject other brown dwarf candidates outside 0.25'' for both systems, and giant planet companions outside 0.5'' that are more massive than 3 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} for the PZ Tel system. We also show that K1-K2 color can be used along with YJH low-resolution spectra to identify young L-type companions, provided high photometric accuracy (≤0.05 mag) is achieved. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: SPHERE opens new horizons in the study of young brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets using direct imaging thanks to high-contrast imaging capabilities at optical (0.5-0.9 μm) and near-infrared (0.95-2.3 μm) wavelengths, as well as high signal-to-noise spectroscopy in the near-infrared domain (0.95-2.3 μm) from low resolutions (R {\textasciitilde} 30-50) to medium resolutions (R {\textasciitilde} 350). {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on data collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile, during the commissioning of the SPHERE instrument and ESO programs 085.C-0277, 087.C-0109, 087.C-0535, and 060.A-9026.},

	abstract = {We present new observations of the low-mass companion to HD 984 taken with the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) as a part of the GPI Exoplanet Survey campaign. Images of HD 984 B were obtained in the J (1.12-1.3 μm) and H (1.50-1.80 μm) bands. Combined with archival epochs from 2012 and 2014, we fit the first orbit to the companion to find an 18 au (70-year) orbit with a 68\% confidence interval between 14 and 28 au, an eccentricity of 0.18 with a 68\% confidence interval between 0.05 and 0.47, and an inclination of 119° with a 68\% confidence interval between 114° and 125°. To address the considerable spectral covariance in both spectra, we present a method of splitting the spectra into low and high frequencies to analyze the spectral structure at different spatial frequencies with the proper spectral noise correlation. Using the split spectra, we compare them to known spectral types using field brown dwarf and low-mass star spectra and find a best-fit match of a field gravity M6.5 ± 1.5 spectral type with a corresponding temperature of \{2730\}-180+120 K. Photometry of the companion yields a luminosity of \{log\}(\{L\}\{bol\}/\{L\}⊙ )=-2.88+/- 0.07 dex with DUSTY models. Mass estimates, again from DUSTY models, find an age-dependent mass of 34 ± 1 to 95 ± 4 M Jup. These results are consistent with previous measurements of the object.},

	abstract = {We report the discovery of a low-mass companion to the nearby (d = 47 pc) F7V star HD 984. The companion is detected 0.19 arcsec away from its host star in the L' band with the Apodized Phase Plate on NaCo/Very Large Telescope and was recovered by L'-band non-coronagraphic imaging data taken a few days later. We confirm the companion is comoving with the star with SINFONI integral field spectrograph H + K data. We present the first published data obtained with SINFONI in pupil-tracking mode. HD 984 has been argued to be a kinematic member of the 30 Myr-old Columba group, and its HR diagram position is not altogether inconsistent with being a zero-age main sequence star of this age. By consolidating different age indicators, including isochronal age, coronal X-ray emission, and stellar rotation, we independently estimate a main-sequence age of 115 ± 85 Myr (95 per cent CL) which does not rely on this kinematic association. The mass of directly imaged companions are usually inferred from theoretical evolutionary tracks, which are highly dependent on the age of the star. Based on the age extrema, we demonstrate that with our photometric data alone, the companion's mass is highly uncertain: between 33 and 96 MJup (0.03-0.09 M⊙) using the COND evolutionary models. We compare the companion's SINFONI spectrum with field dwarf spectra to break this degeneracy. Based on the slope and shape of the spectrum in the H band, we conclude that the companion is an M6.0 ± 0.5 dwarf. The age of the system is not further constrained by the companion, as M dwarfs are poorly fit on low-mass evolutionary tracks. This discovery emphasizes the importance of obtaining a spectrum to spectral type companions around F-stars.},

This subsample includes six detected planets and three brown dwarfs; from these detections and our contrast curves we infer the underlying distributions of substellar companions with respect to their mass, semimajor axis, and host stellar mass. We uncover a strong correlation between planet occurrence rate and host star mass, with stars M * {\textgreater} 1.5 M ⊙ more likely to host planets with masses between 2 and 13M Jup and semimajor axes of 3-100 au at 99.92\% confidence. We fit a double power-law model in planet mass (m) and semimajor axis (a) for planet populations around high-mass stars (M * {\textgreater} 1.5 M ⊙) of the form \{d\}2N/(\{dm\} \{da\}){\textbackslash}propto \{m\}α \{a\}β , finding α = -2.4 ± 0.8 and β = -2.0 ± 0.5, and an integrated occurrence rate of \{9\}-4+5\% between 5-13M Jup and 10-100 au. A significantly lower occurrence rate is obtained for brown dwarfs around all stars, with \{0.8\}-0.5+0.8\% of stars hosting a brown dwarf companion between 13-80M Jup and 10-100 au. Brown dwarfs also appear to be distributed differently in mass and semimajor axis compared to giant planets; whereas giant planets follow a bottom-heavy mass distribution and favor smaller semimajor axes, brown dwarfs exhibit just the opposite behaviors. Comparing to studies of short-period giant planets from the radial velocity method, our results are consistent with a peak in occurrence of giant planets between ∼1 and 10 au. We discuss how these trends, including the preference of giant planets for high-mass host stars, point to formation of giant planets by core/pebble accretion, and formation of brown dwarfs by gravitational instability.},

High-cadence time-series spectra were obtained with the Cryogenic high-resolution InfraRed Échelle Spectrograph at Very Large Telescope, Unit 1 on two closely separated nights. Deconvolution yielded spectroscopic profiles with mean signal-to-noise ratios of several thousand, enabling the near-infrared contrast ratios predicted for the HD179949 system to be achieved. Recent models have predicted that the hottest planets may exhibit spectral signatures in emission due to the presence of TiO and VO which may be responsible for a temperature inversion high in the atmosphere. We have used our phase-dependent orbital model and tomographic techniques to search for the planetary signature under the assumption of an absorption line dominated atmospheric spectrum, where T and V are depleted from the atmospheric model, and an emission line dominated spectrum, where TiO and VO are present. We do not detect a planet in either case, but the 2.120-2.174-μm wavelength region covered by our observations enables the deepest near-infrared limits yet to be placed on the planet/star contrast ratio of any close orbiting extrasolar giant planet system. We are able to rule out the presence of an atmosphere dominated by absorption opacities in the case of HD179949b at a contrast ratio of Fp/F* {\textasciitilde} 1/3350, with 99 per cent confidence.},

The first point is the indication of transition from fully-convective internal structure to the developing radiative core, and the second point, the transition from proton-proton cycle to the carbon-nitrogen cycle as the dominant source of nuclear energy in these stars. It seems that these critical points are important in constraining on the stellar models. Improved set of more parameters for stars particularly around the critical points where the slopes of the relations change, may help bringing the theory and observations closer.},

	abstract = {Context. Young nearby stars are good candidates in the search for planets with both radial velocity (RV) and direct imaging techniques. This, in turn, allows for the computation of the giant planet occurrence rates at all separations. The RV search around young stars is a challenge as they are generally faster rotators than older stars of similar spectral types and they exhibit signatures of magnetic activity (spots) or pulsation in their RV time series. Specific analyses are necessary to characterize, and possibly correct for, this activity. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: Our aim is to search for planets around young nearby stars and to estimate the giant planet (GP) occurrence rates for periods up to 1000 days. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We used the HARPS spectrograph on the 3.6 m telescope at La Silla Observatory to observe 89 A-M young (\&lt;600 Myr) stars. We used our SAFIR (Spectroscopic data via Analysis of the Fourier Interspectrum Radial velocities) software to compute the RV and other spectroscopic observables.

	abstract = {HD95086 (A8V, 17Myr) hosts a rare planetary system for which a multi-belt debris disk and a giant planet of 4-5MJup have been directly imaged. Our study aims to characterize the physical and orbital properties of HD95086b, search for additional planets at short and wide orbits and image the cold outer debris belt in scattered light. We used HARPS at the ESO 3.6m telescope to monitor the radial velocity of HD95086 over 2 years and investigate the existence of giant planets at less than 3au orbital distance. With the IRDIS dual-band imager and the IFS integral field spectrograph of SPHERE at VLT, we imaged the faint circumstellar environment beyond 10au at six epochs between 2015 and 2017. We do not detect additional giant planets around HD95086. We identified the nature (bound companion or background contaminant) of all point-like sources detected in the IRDIS field of view. None of them correspond to the ones recently discovered near the edge of the cold outer belt by ALMA. HD95086b is resolved for the first time in J-band with IFS. Its near-infrared spectral energy distribution is well fitted by a few dusty and/or young L7-L9 dwarf spectral templates. The extremely red 1-4um spectral distribution is typical of low-gravity objects at the L/T spectral type transition. The planet's orbital motion is resolved between January 2015 and May 2017. Together with past NaCo measurements properly re-calibrated, our orbital fitting solutions favor a retrograde low to moderate-eccentricity orbit e=0.2 (0.0 to 0.5), with a semi-major axis 52au corresponding to orbital periods of 288\$ yrs and an inclination that peaks at i = 141deg, which is compatible with a planet-disk coplanar configuration. Finally, we report the detection in polarimetric differential imaging of the cold outer debris belt between 100 and 300au, consistent in radial extent with recent ALMA 1.3mm resolved observations.},

The circumstellar disk of the Herbig Fe star {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}HD 142527{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater} is host to several remarkable features including a warped inner disk, a 120 au-wide annular gap, a prominent dust trap and several spiral arms. A low-mass companion, {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}HD 142527{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater} B, was also found orbiting the primary star at 14 au. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: This study aims to better characterize this companion, which could help explain its impact on the peculiar geometry of the disk. Method. We observed the source with VLT/SINFONI in H + K band in pupil-tracking mode. Data were post-processed with several algorithms based on angular differential imaging (ADI). {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}HD 142527{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater} B is conspicuously re-detected in most spectral channels, which enables us to extract the first medium-resolution spectrum of a low-mass companion within 0.″1 from its central star. Fitting our spectrum with both template and synthetic spectra suggests that the companion is a young M2.5 ± 1.0 star with an effective temperature of 3500 ± 100 K, possibly surrounded with a hot (1700 K) circum-secondary environment. Pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks provide a mass estimate of 0.34 ± 0.06 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, independent of the presence of a hot environment. However, the estimated stellar radius and age do depend on that assumption; we find a radius of 1.37 ± 0.05 R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} (resp. 1.96 ± 0.10 R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) and an age of 1.8{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.5{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+1.2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} Myr (resp. 0.75 ± 0.25 Myr) in the case of the presence (resp. absence) of a hot environment contributing in H + K.

	abstract = {Context. Direct imaging of extrasolar giant planets demands the highest possible contrasts (ΔH ≳ 10 mag) at the smallest angular separations (∼0.1″) from the star. We present an adaptive optics observing method, called star-hopping, recently offered as standard queue observing (service mode) for the SPHERE instrument at the VLT. The method uses reference difference imaging (RDI) but, unlike earlier RDI applications, images of a reference star for PSF subtraction are obtained within minutes of observing the target star. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We aim to significantly gain in contrast beyond the conventional angular differencing imaging (ADI) method to search for a fifth planet at separations less than 10 au, interior to the four giant planets of the HR 8799 system. The most likely semimajor axes allowed for this hypothetical planet, which were estimated via dynamical simulations in earlier works, were 7.5 au and 9.7 au within a mass range of 1-8 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We obtained 4.5 h of simultaneous low-resolution integral field spectroscopy (R ∼ 30, Y − H band with IFS) and dual-band imaging (K1 and K2 bands with IRDIS) of the HR 8799 system, interspersed with observations of a reference star. The reference star was observed for about one-third of the total time and generally needs to be of similar brightness (ΔR ≲ 1 mag) and separated on sky by ≲1-2°. The hops between stars were made every 6-10 min, with only 1 min gaps in on-sky integration per hop. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We did not detect the hypothetical fifth planet at the most plausible separations, 7.5 and 9.7 au, down to mass limits of 3.6 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and 2.8 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, respectively, but attained an unprecedented contrast limit of 11.2 magnitudes at 0.1″. We detected all four planets with high signal-to-noise ratios. The YJH spectra for planets c, d were detected with redder H-band spectral slopes than found in earlier studies. As noted in previous works, the planet spectra are matched very closely by some red field dwarfs. Finally, comparing the current locations of the planets to orbital solutions, we found that planets e and c are most consistent with coplanar and resonant orbits. We also demonstrated that with star-hopping RDI, the contrast improvement at 0.1″ separation can be up to 2 mag. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Since ADI, meridian transit and the concomitant sky rotation are not needed, the time of observation can be chosen from within a window that is two to three times larger. In general, star-hopping can be used for stars fainter than R = 4 magnitudes, since for these a reference star of suitable brightness and separation is usually available. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}The reduction software used in this paper has been made available online ({\textless}A href="https://github.com/zwahhaj/starhopping"{\textgreater}https://github.com/zwahhaj/starhopping{\textless}/A{\textgreater}).},

	abstract = {Context. The system of fourplanets discovered around the intermediate-mass star HR8799 offers a unique opportunity to test planet formation theories at large orbital radii and to probe the physics and chemistry at play in the atmospheres of self-luminous young ({\textasciitilde}30 Myr) planets. We recently obtained new photometry of the four planets and low-resolution (R {\textasciitilde} 30) spectra of HR8799 d and e with the SPHERE instrument (Paper III). {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: In this paper (Paper IV), we aim to use these spectra and available photometry to determine how they compare to known objects, what the planet physical properties are, and how their atmospheres work. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We compare the available spectra, photometry, and spectral energy distribution (SED) of the planets to field dwarfs and young companions. In addition, we use the extinction from corundum, silicate (enstatite and forsterite), or iron grains likely to form in the atmosphere of the planets to try to better understand empirically the peculiarity of their spectrophotometric properties. To conclude, we use three sets of atmospheric models (BT-SETTL14, Cloud-AE60, Exo-REM) to determine which ingredients are critically needed in the models to represent the SED of the objects, and to constrain their atmospheric parameters (T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, log g, M/H). {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We find that HR8799d and e properties are well reproduced by those of L6-L8 dusty dwarfs discovered in the field, among which some are candidate members of young nearby associations. No known object reproduces well the properties of planets b and c. Nevertheless, we find that the spectra and WISE photometry of peculiar and/or young early-T dwarfs reddened by submicron grains made of corundum, iron, enstatite, or forsterite successfully reproduce the SED of these planets. Our analysis confirms that only the Exo-REM models with thick clouds fit (within 2σ) the whole set of spectrophotometric datapoints available for HR8799 d and e for T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 1200 K, log g in the range 3.0-4.5, and M/H = +0.5. The models still fail to reproduce the SED of HR8799c and b. The determination of the metallicity, log g, and cloud thickness are degenerate. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Our empirical analysis and atmospheric modelling show that an enhanced content in dust and decreased CIA of H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} is certainly responsible for the deviation of the properties of the planet with respect to field dwarfs. The analysis suggests in addition that HR8799c and b have later spectral types than the two other planets, and therefore could both have lower masses. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile, during the commissioning of the SPHERE instrument},

The planetary system discovered around the young A-type HR 8799 provides a unique laboratory to: a) test planet formation theories; b) probe the diversity of system architectures at these separations, and c) perform comparative (exo)planetology. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We present and exploit new near-infrared images and integral-field spectra of the four gas giants surrounding HR 8799 obtained with SPHERE, the new planet finder instrument at the Very Large Telescope, during the commissioning and science verification phase of the instrument (July-December 2014). With these new data, we contribute to completing the spectral energy distribution (SED) of these bodies in the 1.0-2.5 μm range. We also provide new astrometric data, in particular for planet e, to further constrain the orbits. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We used the infrared dual-band imager and spectrograph (IRDIS) subsystem to obtain pupil-stabilized, dual-band H2H3 (1.593 μm, 1.667 μm), K1K2 (2.110 μm, 2.251 μm), and broadband J (1.245 μm) images of the four planets. IRDIS was operated in parallel with the integral field spectrograph (IFS) of SPHERE to collect low-resolution (R {\textasciitilde} 30), near-infrared (0.94-1.64 μm) spectra of the two innermost planets HR 8799 d and e. The data were reduced with dedicated algorithms, such as the Karhunen-Loève image projection (KLIP), to reveal the planets. We used the so-called negative planets injection technique to extract their photometry, spectra, and measure their positions. We illustrate the astrometric performance of SPHERE through sample orbital fits compatible with SPHERE and literature data. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We demonstrated the ability of SPHERE to detect and characterize planets in this kind of systems, providing spectra and photometry of its components. The spectra improve upon the signal-to-noise ratio of previously obtained data and increase the spectral coverage down to the Y band. In addition, we provide the first detection of planet e in the J band. Astrometric positions for planets HR 8799 bcde are reported for the epochs of July, August, and December 2014. We measured the photometric values in J, H2H3, K1K2 bands for the four planets with a mean accuracy of 0.13 mag.

Our new measurements are more consistent with the two inner planets d and e being in a 2d:1e or 3d:2e resonance. The spectra of HR 8799 d and e are well matched by those of L6-8 field dwarfs.

	abstract = {Young and dynamically active planetary systems can form disks of debris that are easier to image than the planets themselves. The morphology and evolution of these disks can help to infer the properties of the putative planets responsible for generating and shaping the debris structures. We present integral field spectroscopy and dual-band imaging from VLT/SPHERE (1.0-1.7 μm) of the debris disk around the young F2V/F3V star HD 115600. We aim to (1) characterize the geometry and composition of the debris ring, (2) search for thermal emission of young giant planets, and (3) in the absence of detected planets, to refine the inferred properties of plausible planets around HD 115600 to prepare future attempts to detect them. Using a different dust scattering model (ZODIPIC) than in the discovery paper to model the disk geometry, we find a 0 = 46 ± 2 au for the disk’s central radius and offsets Δα, Δδ = -1.0 ± 0.5, 0.5 ± 0.5 au. This offset is smaller than previously found, suggesting that unseen planets of lower masses could be sculpting the disk. Spectroscopy of the disk in Y-J bands with SPHERE shows reddish color, which becomes neutral or slightly blue in H-band seen with GPI, broadly consistent with a mixed bulk disk composition of processed organics and water ice. While our observed field contains numerous background objects at wide separations, no exoplanet has been directly observed to a mass sensitivity limit of 2 - 3(5 - 7) M J between a projected separation of 40 and 200 au for hot (cold)-start models.},

In this work, we measure the dynamical mass and orbit of the young substellar companion HD 984 B. We obtained new high-contrast imaging of the HD 984 system with Keck/NIRC2 that expands the baseline of relative astrometry from 3 to 8 yr. We also present new radial velocities of the host star with the Habitable-Zone Planet Finder spectrograph at the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. Furthermore, HD 984 exhibits a significant proper motion difference between Hipparcos and Gaia EDR3. Our joint orbit fit of the relative astrometry, proper motions, and radial velocities yields a dynamical mass of 61 ± 4 M Jup for HD 984 B, placing the companion firmly in the brown dwarf regime. The new fit also reveals a higher eccentricity for the companion (e = 0.76 ± 0.05) compared to previous orbit fits. Given the broad age constraint for HD 984, this mass is consistent with predictions from evolutionary models. HD 984 B's dynamical mass places it among a small but growing list of giant planet and brown dwarf companions with direct mass measurements.},

	abstract = {Context. In recent decades, direct imaging has confirmed the existence of substellar companions (exoplanets or brown dwarfs) on wide orbits (\&gt;10 au) around their host stars. In striving to understand their formation and evolution mechanisms, in 2015 we initiated the SPHERE infrared survey for exoplanets (SHINE), a systematic direct imaging survey of young, nearby stars that is targeted at exploring their demographics. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We aim to detect and characterize the population of giant planets and brown dwarfs beyond the snow line around young, nearby stars. Combined with the survey completeness, our observations offer the opportunity to constrain the statistical properties (occurrence, mass and orbital distributions, dependency on the stellar mass) of these young giant planets. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: In this study, we present the observing and data analysis strategy, the ranking process of the detected candidates, and the survey performances for a subsample of 150 stars that are representative of the full SHINE sample. Observations were conducted in a homogeneous way between February 2015 and February 2017 with the dedicated ground-based VLT/SPHERE instrument equipped with the IFS integral field spectrograph and the IRDIS dual-band imager, covering a spectral range between 0.9 and 2.3 μm. We used coronographic, angular, and spectral differential imaging techniques to achieve the best detection performances for this study, down to the planetary mass regime. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We processed, in a uniform manner, more than 300 SHINE observations and datasets to assess the survey typical sensitivity as a function of the host star and of the observing conditions. The median detection performance reached 5σ-contrasts of 13 mag at 200 mas and 14.2 mag at 800 mas with the IFS (YJ and YJH bands), and of 11.8 mag at 200 mas, 13.1 mag at 800 mas, and 15.8 mag at 3 as with IRDIS in H band, delivering one of the deepest sensitivity surveys thus far for young, nearby stars. A total of sixteen substellar companions were imaged in this first part of SHINE: seven brown dwarf companions and ten planetary-mass companions.These include two new discoveries, HIP 65426 b and HIP 64892 B, but not the planets around PDS70 that had not been originally selected for the SHINE core sample. A total of 1483 candidates were detected, mainly in the large field of view that characterizes IRDIS. The color-magnitude diagrams, low-resolution spectrum (when available with IFS), and follow-up observations enabled us to identify the nature (background contaminant or comoving companion) of about 86\% of our subsample. The remaining cases are often connected to crowded-field follow-up observations that were missing. Finally, even though SHINE was not initially designed for disk searches, we imaged twelve circumstellar disks, including three new detections around the HIP 73145, HIP 86598, and HD 106906 systems. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Nowadays, direct imaging provides a unique opportunity to probe the outer part of exoplanetary systems beyond 10 au to explore planetary architectures, as highlighted by the discoveries of: one new exoplanet, one new brown dwarf companion, and three new debris disks during this early phase of SHINE. It also offers the opportunity to explore and revisit the physical and orbital properties of these young, giant planets and brown dwarf companions (relative position, photometry, and low-resolution spectrum in near-infrared, predicted masses, and contrast in order to search for additional companions). Finally, these results highlight the importance of finalizing the SHINE systematic observation of about 500 young, nearby stars for a full exploration of their outer part to explore the demographics of young giant planets beyond 10 au and to identify the most interesting systems for the next generation of high-contrast imagers on very large and extremely large telescopes. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Full Table A.1 is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{\textgreater}cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/651/A71"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/651/A71{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Observations of circumstellar environments that look for the direct signal of exoplanets and the scattered light from disks have significant instrumental implications. In the past 15 years, major developments in adaptive optics, coronagraphy, optical manufacturing, wavefront sensing, and data processing, together with a consistent global system analysis have brought about a new generation of high-contrast imagers and spectrographs on large ground-based telescopes with much better performance. One of the most productive imagers is the Spectro-Polarimetic High contrast imager for Exoplanets REsearch (SPHERE), which was designed and built for the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile. SPHERE includes an extreme adaptive optics system, a highly stable common path interface, several types of coronagraphs, and three science instruments. Two of them, the Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) and the Infra-Red Dual-band Imager and Spectrograph (IRDIS), were designed to efficiently cover the near-infrared range in a single observation for an efficient search of young planets. The third instrument, ZIMPOL, was designed for visible polarimetric observation to look for the reflected light of exoplanets and the light scattered by debris disks. These three scientific instruments enable the study of circumstellar environments at unprecedented angular resolution, both in the visible and the near-infrared. In this work, we thoroughly present SPHERE and its on-sky performance after four years of operations at the VLT.},

It combines a very high-order adaptive optics system, a diffraction-suppressing coronagraph, and an integral field spectrograph with low spectral resolution but high spatial resolution. Every aspect of the Gemini Planet Imager has been tuned for maximum sensitivity to faint planets near bright stars. During first-light observations, we achieved an estimated H band Strehl ratio of 0.89 and a 5-σ contrast of 106 at 0.75 arcseconds and 105 at 0.35 arcseconds. Observations of Beta Pictoris clearly detect the planet, Beta Pictoris b, in a single 60-s exposure with minimal postprocessing. Beta Pictoris b is observed at a separation of 434 ± 6 milliarcseconds (mas) and position angle 211.8 ± 0.5°. Fitting the Keplerian orbit of Beta Pic b using the new position together with previous astrometry gives a factor of 3 improvement in most parameters over previous solutions. The planet orbits at a semimajor axis of 9.0-0.4+0.8 AU near the 3:2 resonance with the previously known 6-AU asteroidal belt and is aligned with the inner warped disk.

	abstract = {Resolved debris disc images can exhibit a range of radial and azimuthal structures, including gaps and rings, which can result from planetary companions shaping the disc by their gravitational influence. Currently, there are no tools available to determine the architecture of potential companions from disc observations. Recent work by Rodigas, Malhotra \& Hinz presents how one can estimate the maximum mass and minimum semimajor axis of a hidden planet empirically from the width of the disc in scattered light. In this work, we use the predictions of Rodigas et al. applied to two debris discs HD 202628 and HD 207129. We aim to test if the predicted orbits of the planets can explain the features of their debris disc, such as eccentricity and sharp inner edge. We first run dynamical simulations using the predicted planetary parameters of Rodigas et al., and then numerically search for better parameters. Using a modified N-body code including radiation forces, we perform simulations over a broad range of planet parameters and compare synthetics images from our simulations to the observations. We find that the observational features of HD 202628 can be reproduced with a planet five times smaller than expected, located 30 AU beyond the predicted value, while the best match for HD 207129 is for a planet located 5-10 AU beyond the predicted location with a smaller eccentricity. We conclude that the predictions of Rodigas et al. provide a good starting point but should be complemented by numerical simulations.},

	abstract = {Directly imaging exoplanets is challenging because quasi-static phase aberrations in the pupil plane (speckles) can mimic the signal of a companion at small angular separations. Kernel phase, which is a generalization of closure phase (known from sparse aperture masking), is independent of pupil plane phase noise to second order and allows for a robust calibration of full pupil, extreme adaptive optics observations. We applied kernel phase combined with a principal component based calibration process to a suitable but not optimal, high cadence, pupil stabilized L'-band (3.8 \{μ m\}) data set from the ESO archive. We detect eight low-mass companions, five of which were previously unknown, and two have angular separations of ∼0.8-1.2 λ/D (i.e. ∼80-110 mas), demonstrating that kernel phase achieves a resolution below the classical diffraction limit of a telescope. While we reach a 5σ contrast limit of ∼1/100 at such angular separations, we demonstrate that an optimized observing strategy with more diversity of PSF references (e.g. star-hopping sequences) would have led to a better calibration and even better performance. As such, kernel phase is a promising technique for achieving the best possible resolution with future space-based telescopes (e.g. James Webb Space Telescope), which are limited by the mirror size rather than atmospheric turbulence, and with a dedicated calibration process also for extreme adaptive optics facilities from the ground.},

	abstract = {We announce the discovery of two planets orbiting the M dwarfs GJ 251 (0.360 ± 0.015M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) and HD 238090 (0.578 ± 0.021M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) based on CARMENES radial velocity (RV) data. In addition, we independently confirm with CARMENES data the existence of Lalande 21185 b, a planet that has recently been discovered with the SOPHIE spectrograph. All three planets belong to the class of warm or temperate super-Earths and share similar properties. The orbital periods are 14.24 d, 13.67 d, and 12.95 d and the minimum masses are 4.0 ± 0.4 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊕{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, 6.9 ± 0.9 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊕{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and 2.7 ± 0.3 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊕{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} for GJ 251 b, HD 238090 b, and Lalande 21185 b, respectively. Based on the orbital and stellar properties, we estimate equilibrium temperatures of 351.0 ± 1.4 K for GJ 251 b, 469.6 ± 2.6 K for HD 238090 b, and 370.1 ± 6.8 K for Lalande 21185 b. For the latter we resolve the daily aliases that were present in the SOPHIE data and that hindered an unambiguous determination of the orbital period. We find no significant signals in any of our spectral activity indicators at the planetary periods. The RV observations were accompanied by contemporaneous photometric observations. We derive stellar rotation periods of 122.1 ± 2.2 d and 96.7 ± 3.7 d for GJ 251 and HD 238090, respectively. The RV data of all three stars exhibit significant signals at the rotational period or its first harmonic. For GJ 251 and Lalande 21185, we also find long-period signals around 600 d, and 2900 d, respectively, which we tentatively attribute to long-term magnetic cycles. We apply a Bayesian approach to carefully model the Keplerian signals simultaneously with the stellar activity using Gaussian process regression models and extensively search for additional significant planetary signals hidden behind the stellar activity. Current planet formation theories suggest that the three systems represent a common architecture, consistent with formation following the core accretion paradigm. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Tables D.1-D.3 are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/643/A112"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/643/A112{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {We introduce dynamic nested sampling: a generalisation of the nested sampling algorithm in which the number of “live points” varies to allocate samples more efficiently. In empirical tests the new method significantly improves calculation accuracy compared to standard nested sampling with the same number of samples; this increase in accuracy is equivalent to speeding up the computation by factors of up to \$\${\textbackslash}sim 72\$\$for parameter estimation and \$\${\textbackslash}sim 7\$\$for evidence calculations. We also show that the accuracy of both parameter estimation and evidence calculations can be improved simultaneously. In addition, unlike in standard nested sampling, more accurate results can be obtained by continuing the calculation for longer. Popular standard nested sampling implementations can be easily adapted to perform dynamic nested sampling, and several dynamic nested sampling software packages are now publicly available.},

	abstract = {The application of Bayesian methods in cosmology and astrophysics has flourished over the past decade, spurred by data sets of increasing size and complexity. In many respects, Bayesian methods have proven to be vastly superior to more traditional statistical tools, offering the advantage of higher efficiency and of a consistent conceptual basis for dealing with the problem of induction in the presence of uncertainty. This trend is likely to continue in the future, when the way we collect, manipulate and analyse observations and compare them with theoretical models will assume an even more central role in cosmology. This review is an introduction to Bayesian methods in cosmology and astrophysics and recent results in the field. I first present Bayesian probability theory and its conceptual underpinnings, Bayes' Theorem and the role of priors. I discuss the problem of parameter inference and its general solution, along with numerical techniques such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods. I then review the theory and application of Bayesian model comparison, discussing the notions of Bayesian evidence and effective model complexity, and how to compute and interpret those quantities. Recent developments in cosmological parameter extraction and Bayesian cosmological model building are summarized, highlighting the challenges that lie ahead.},
